-GhhcZUYmMk,"So I started using drugs when I was 12 years old. Really I just wanted to fit in with everyone, you know, smoking weed and drinking and doing a lot of LSD actually. I was this hippie chick, I was going to fish shows and doing a lot of things that a normal 12, 13, 14 year old does not do. I had a lot of freedom growing up as a child, so I just kind of did whatever I wanted to do and I really had very, very, very low self-esteem and had a lot of stuff going on in my household as a child. So this was kind of my outlet of being able to make friends and just try to be a part of something in this world. And then when I was 17, that's when I started using heroin and my life really went downhill after the age of 17. I used heroin and other opiates, but really specifically heroin for about nine years. When I was 17, I overdosed at a party and they did not want to call 911. So I believe in guardian angels. So there was a guardian angel I had seen earlier that day that I called and I told her I was dying. I don't remember any of this. This is what she told me. So she came to the party. She busted up in there. She called 911 and she and an off-duty police officer that lived in the neighborhood saved my life. I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for those two. And he gave me CPR until they got there with the Narcan nalaxone and brought me back to life. I do remember bits and pieces of that. It was horrible. It was not fun whatsoever. And then that's when my parents found out I was using drugs. So I hit it well for about five years and from the hospital detox and doing everything they had to do to revive me, I started a lot of different forms of treatment for my heroin usage. Really, I'd got addicted right after that. I had shots in my butt to help me detox. I tried Jesus. I got baptized. I tried therapy. I hated it. I tried 12 step. I went to my first 12 step meeting when I was 17. Everyone was like 100 years old and I was 17 years old. So I did like two of those. That was not my jam. And I didn't get rid of the friends, so-called friends that I was hanging out with that was using heroin. So I went back to using it pretty quickly within a month or so. And from that, it just took over my entire life. I was young, but I had already grown up pretty quickly because of my household situation and just started using drugs. And I started working when I was 15 to support my drug habit. And once I got physically addicted, my central nervous system took over and I was getting dope sick, aka withdrawal. That's when it really started getting bad. So about the age of 19, I mean, I used that whole time, but about the age of 19 is really when I was full blown, needed it every day, lie cheated, steal to get money or drugs in order to get it every single day. And then, like I said, I tried a few different things. It was really for my family. I put them through living hell as we do when we're in active addiction. And I just didn't know what recovery was. I was mandated to go to groups and to acupuncture and stuff like that. I didn't know really truly what the recovery peer-to-peer movement was because back then, because I'm 44 now, so that was 100 years ago. But back then it just wasn't like it is now. And then when I was 21, I got pregnant with my daughter. So I figured, okay, I could stop using drugs now. I was actually on a methadone clinic trying to get into recovery again. And they did a pregnancy test and I found out there. So for me, they told me, you need to be on methadone because you're pregnant. You're supposed to do it through your whole term, your whole pregnancy. And I was like, no, I'm not putting drugs in my baby's body. So I left that clinic and within two days, I think, I started using heroin again. So I did use my whole pregnancy with my daughter. And she was born, substance exposed and had to stay in the NICU for about two weeks. So they had to detox her. After services came, they checked my house for one visit. They mandated me to methadone, so they didn't take her from me. And then I still kept using every other drug those two years. On paper, I graduated and was great, but I definitely was still using because I was full blown, just addicted to anything, any type of drug. Because I didn't like the human being that I was and definitely hated myself for the things that I did to my daughter. So keeping using and keeping continually filling that void is what I needed to do to survive. It was pretty rough. I put her through a lot. And I've forgiven myself and she's forgiven me. She'll be 23 next week in two weeks. So we have a great relationship now and we've had it for years because of recovery. But it was tough. I was still a young, a lot of 21 year olds now. I couldn't imagine her having a child being addicted to heroin. I'm like, this girl would not make it because she can't clean her room still. It was a living hell. That's all I can really say. It was disgusting. I was doing things as a woman that I needed to do to get drugs or money. She was in the getaway car for robberies, for drug deals. So I definitely put her in a lot of danger. She doesn't remember all that. So I'm very fortunate for that as well. And then I finally went to treatment again, a 28 day program in Winchester, Virginia. And that was my first time in 13 years of being completely drug free. I mean, I was smoking cigarettes and on detox meds. But that 28 days was weird. I was still in a fog. I had left her biological father over the pay phone. We were together for six long, miserable years because we were just focused on drugs. And that's how we met. And that's how we stayed together. And I walked outside after breaking up with him and fell in lust immediately to another boy that was playing basketball. Because that's what you do in rehab, right? And it was a rehab romance. He moved here to Richmond. And we went to 12-step meetings for a month or so. So that was one month out of the 14 years of me using, of really trying to focus on recovery. I got a sponsor. I got a home group, all that stuff that the treatment center told me to do. But then he stopped going to meetings. So I stopped going to meetings. And then ultimately, we both started using behind each other's back for two days. And then we used together for about a year. And that last year of my addiction was the worst year of the whole 14 years, physically, mentally, spiritually, everything I did to destiny, my daughter, myself, my body. It was rough. It was really hard. Being dope sick is absolutely horrifying. I was not a good dope sick person. I would physically harm you or myself if I was in withdrawal. Yeah. So that was real fun. And then finally, when I was 26 years old, destiny was five. My mom knew the founder, John Schinholzer, of here, the Mixed Gen Foundation. So I came here on one last effort to try to really please them. And I was dope sick. And they had access to a doctor that could give me medication. So that's really why I came. I just wanted the medication. I didn't want recovery because I don't do well, like, listening to anyone when I'm dope sick. So let alone listening to people talk about recovery and how to not use drugs anymore. So that was not fun. I left. I came and I left for about four days. I ran down that road to go get my car from the recovery house. So my then boyfriend, now husband, that I'm at in rehab, we are that 1% that makes it. But we left. And then John let me come back. And I just, my plan was to detox for like a week and leave, but something magical happened here. I lived in the female recovery house. McShin had one female house and two male houses at the time back in 2007. And I lived here for five months. I worked. I had my driver's license and a car. And I did odd jobs for all those five months. You know, recovery was really taught to me living in this environment, living in a house with other women that were trying to get their life together. A peer led run organization is what saved my life in the 12 step community. Cause back then it wasn't a lot of women staying in recovery. It was really a handful that were in 12 step in this area. And they all just adopted me because there was no female staff here at the time. It was three male staff back then. And then after the five months, I got my daughter back immediately. My sister let me move in with her. And I started working here at McShin when I was five months in recovery. So wild saying that, but I was five months in recovery and I really just wanted to give back to the women. I knew a little bit of administrative skills. I had in plenty of jobs when I was using drugs, but I learned some things. I never went to college or graduated high school when I was 16 a year early in order to support my drug habit. It wasn't because I was super, super smart. I just wanted to get the heck out of there and do more drugs. But something here, the most magical thing about McShin is the peer to peer connection is other people that have experienced not just addiction, but long-term recovery or just recovery for an extra day longer than I did. And we've built this organization to what it is now. It has been a journey. So McShin has been around for 20 years. I just celebrated 17 years of employment. I have 17 and a half years in recovery, May 27th. 2007 is my recovery date. I haven't used alcohol, anything, no heroin, nothing since that day. So I'm very proud of that day. And now the McShin Foundation, we have 15 recovery homes. We have our women and children recovery house, which I've been wanting to do since the day I started working here. It took me and this organization and our team a very long time. So we just opened that in 2023. It is named after my daughter. So it is called Destiny House because the drive and the passion of our story really kicked me in gear to find funding, which we found. And I've gotten two grants for that house so the moms don't have to pay anything and get on their feet with their child, which is the most beautiful thing in the whole entire universe if you ask me. And we have judicial programs. So we're in two local jails, delivering peer to peer recovery support services. Our staff and team here rocks everyone. Well, for the most part, everyone is in recovery. Everyone's been affected by recovery. Our board of directors is made up of those in recovery and have been affected by substance use disorder as well. I walk on my purpose every single day. I have no question, no question at all. It's not perfect. And I go through stuff and just because I'm in recovery doesn't mean people are going to be kind to me and things aren't going to happen in the world. The reality of it is I don't want to be in any other place besides a recovery and be here at the Mixion Foundation. So being the CEO of this organization has changed my life tremendously. I am a leader. I'm a female leader. I get to help people every single day with substance use disorders and not even just the individuals, but their families. I get to see these children run around and have their mommies in their life. That's just, that's the best part. I mean, honestly, I raise money. I ask people for money all the time. I never wanted to do that. I was scared to death for years, at least the first 10 years because the founder just retired last December 31st on 2023. So this past year, I've been the full lead along with our board of directors and our CEO, Jesse Wasaki. But yeah, I have lost a lot of friends, really, really close friends to fentanyl. The hardest part of this career that I've built for my own substance use disorder is seeing the humans that we serve leave, see them use and see them pass away. I can't even tell you how many memorials or funerals I've been to, hundreds. We have a lot item in our budget that is approved from our board of directors every year. It's called funeral. Oh gosh, it's funeral because those that we serve or their family members sometimes don't have the funds to have food or a pianist or whatever. So we have the memorials here and we pay for that. So we raise money for four funerals because it's just what we do. It's who we are. Those that I have lost are always in my heart. I've got pictures of them all over my office, memories. I've been doing this for over 17 years. The past five or six years have been horrifying of the amount of loss that we've lost. The amount of family members that have been affected by the loss is what gets me, like being a parent to two children because I have a son that's 15 that's never had to see me use. It just breaks my heart. I keep going because I know that this is what I'm meant to be, to do in my life. I have no question about that. Like I said, I have to keep going. We have to keep going. We have to keep helping individuals with substance use disorders and their families because even if we put a little dent in that and save just one family today, that's okay. We serve about 555 people a year living our housing. It's a lot of, and then you multiply that by the families that you're healing. I mean, it's such a beautiful process, but it is a dark side to it. We just provide a safe space for families to heal. We have a beautiful Memorial Garden downstairs outside. We keep going. We keep going. It's tough. I don't want to do nothing else. Even when I retire, I'm going to be doing something in this realm, specifically with moms and children for sure because the next generation is being raised in an environment where their friends are dying. My son and daughter, I constantly, we keep it real in my house. Oh my goodness. We keep it real because talk about fentanyl, talk about pills, talk about parties. Don't even leave your drink. Hold your drink tight to you. I know it's a scary world. Some people may not agree on how a parent, and honestly, really don't care because I know what I see here and I know what I see out there. Just one pill can kill. As a parent, I need to be able to communicate that with my children and I do a very daggone good job. I really do because we just keep it real. I'm like, bro, no, any medication, any protein powder, anything you get from mommy. That's it. You don't get it from nobody else. He knows. He's helped friends, or loved ones of his friends, giving them information about McShane. My daughters definitely help a ton of people get into this organization as well. It's really proud mommy that I'm raising, I'm not a perfect parent by any mean, but I'm raising pretty okay in order for them to show them, you know, to help people out in the world. I just wish everybody did a little bit more of that too. For me and being in this environment for so long and just being a part of a place where you know of so many people not here physically, but that have passed away, there's a point in time where I've come numb to it. I don't even know if I want to use the word numb. It's just I'm used to it. I'm used to people dying and that's horrible. I don't want to say that I was talking to one of our team. I just thought one day this addiction crisis would be over. I didn't think when I started working here all these years ago that we would still be here, you know, and now it's even worse because there's so many different drugs now. I'm choked up because like these are human beings that you get to know and they become a part of your life and then are no longer here. And then I have the opportunity to get close with the family members that are left behind. And as a parent, I just I have I have I'm a tough chick, but I am. I wear my heart on my sleeve. So I'm a leader and I and I work hard at that. But I cry a lot around here, you know, because it's it's very difficult career to have, especially when those that you get close to are never going to walk in your office again.",loaded_from_file,15815,Recovery - Honesty's Story,1181.0,5,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00
0W6KDKYWnyg,"you oh we're brothers me being the older brother you know as the older brother always tries to pick on a little one and I remember a time where we were you know WWF wrestling we he caught me on the stairs and he put me in like a back bend and I just started crying I was so mad because my little brother got me but we we got along we were brothers what brothers do his best friend was our cousin Sammy that was his best friend and we were all best friends we were like brothers and sisters West and Doug and he was just always like the common not trying to fight not trying to argue when it was that but he was just a smart one and he never missed a day of school until he never missed a day of school until senior skip day never missed a day of school we actually my uncle was taking him and I to school one day we were coming around a hill and we hit a pole because it was icy out my brother walked to school that day he was definitely the better half of the brothers definitely the better one more loving and everything and I was more of the party scene starts smoking weed and stuff like that but he stayed in the sports and stayed in the school he was working when he was a senior by the time I was a senior I was locked up I missed a lot of my brother's high school days and a lot of his athletics when he was doing really good and shining I missed it and I kicked my ass for that all the time I wasn't a big brother that I served in he went to western Illinois he was a Leatherneck D1 college athlete and one of my proudest moments was watching my brother pitch against KU I got on his nerves I cheered so loud I was watching me my dad were watching the game of one internet the next season because you know his first year there he he did good but he didn't do well but his second year they were I just remember the announcer calling him a Cinderella story he came home and just never went back got hooked on pain pills and the party scene pain pills that came from my dad because my dad had so many surgeries and stuff my dad needed them to not be in pain I think it was with that was my brother's connection with my dad after my brother got addicted I've always my brother held resentment against my dad for a little bit loving but you know that resentment is there for what my dad was crack head alcoholic I'll say it my dad's gone now too as well but my dad turned into a pill head and I hate saying crack he was addicted to crack sorry and alcoholic and things weren't always good at home because of dad but with mom it was like it was perfect but when he found that connection with my dad it was crazy to say but at the time it was good something we all three bonded over I always tell me why are you here go back to school even through our deepest days of addiction like man you can still go back to school like you can bounce back and I would tell him that even me being high out of my wits I tell him that like I don't know why you're you're sticking around and then one day as we had some oxycodons and I had already been introduced to the needle and my little brother wanted me to shoot him up and I was the first one to put a needle in my brother's arm I think that's what stuck him here all the way take my ass and live with guilt for a long time I know his death is not my fault and he was a grown man he makes his own decisions he wanted me to do it but I should have never done that I should have never done that because I know what it did to me it grabbed me by the devil's horns it just took me all the way with it it should honestly be him speaking about me today honestly up and down trying to get clean some good friends trying to pull him out of it and take him wherever he wanted to go or take him to where they were living they had a friend living in Vegas you take him out there try to get him off but my brother would always come back kind of like I would do I mean Jelom prison saved my life really and my own and myself when I was like okay I'm done but I didn't get that okay I'm done until I lost my brother he'd get arrested and the judges would let him go I wish they wouldn't have one of the judges was a big baseball fan watching high school baseball he remembered him from that and just let him go this was in the beginning it's a story I heard from my dad but I wasn't there it was one of them favoritism things they never gave him the book like they gave me and I wish they would have I really wish they would have did he do anything major to deserve the book don't let him know not like I did but sometimes I wish that incident would have happened because he'd still be here today my brother never got addicted to fintan although it was pain pills and we do heroin here and there but when pain pills got to the point it would be hard to get we would do heroin we were very picky about who we got the heroin from and sometimes it would come with fintan on it we did not want that April I think it was the 20th of 2016 I had got some heroin and there was fintan on it I had to be rushed to the hospital and I woke up ripped everything out of me they didn't even ask me for my name I just left I stole a truck got caught anyways I called my brother and my dad I'm like hey you guys need to be careful and not long after that I lost my little brother while I was locked up from the stories I've gathered up is he gave a friend some money to go get him some heroin or pain pills whatever he could find and from what I've gathered he was in a house did the shot there was fintan on it because at first I was thinking oh the heroin because he was smart even the heroin and the Xanax I could have done it after you know I started thinking about it but then toxicology came back and it was fintan on the system and but anyways when he overdosed from what we gather he was carried to a bathroom left there and that's how my little brother was found I was a trustee in Platt County Jail and we were on break from lunch to dinner and I got a call to go down and I was like oh the captain was like you need to call your family and I was like oh no my dad and she looked at me and she was like no your brother and I

1Qd-N-VGOjE,"I grew up in probably your standard households, you know, two parents, both of master's degrees. We moved around a little bit when I was a kid. My parents were both educators and my dad was really chasing a career, so we moved a little bit. And I always had the sense of I didn't fit in. I was sort of awkward and didn't do well with my peer group necessarily. And so I never really feel like I had a place and or a community. When I was in high school, I felt that I was called to be a nurse. So when I graduated high school, I went to nursing school and had a really great nursing career. I moved away from Texas up to Boston and was doing some nursing consulting work, fell down some stairs and had a back injury and a broken tailbone. So I went to the emergency room and I was immediately prescribed opioids and Xanax to help with pain. And to this day, I'm not really sure why they gave me Xanax, but I took it. But what the experts didn't know was that there was a history of addiction in my family. There is a history of mental health issues in my family. And now we know that there is correlation between people who have addiction and family history and mental health issues. So as much as the doctors did prescribe it and continued to prescribe it for years, they can't be solely responsible because we didn't have all the information that we needed at the time this happened. And also, we can't expect every physician prescribing any type of medication, but especially a controlled substance, to be able to have the time to say, tell me about your family. Is there a history of addiction? And is there a history of mental health issues? I mean, I wish that we had a health system in the United States that did that, but that's not what we currently have. And that's not what we had when I became addicted almost 20 years ago. I still have friends in the medical community and I was in the medical community. So I see both sides, especially now because I have now some personal perspective and some professional perspective and now an expert's perspective on prevention. But with the medical knowledge I have now, I realize that there are a lot of solutions that we could offer to the medical community, but they're not yet at a place to really embrace the solutions. And we're always, this is a change. Change is hard, but it's necessary. Change at the level we're talking about, systemic change is incredibly hard to do. It's incredibly expensive and it takes a lot of voices to get us there. And it's not just the medical community. It's not just your physicians and nurses and pharmacists. It's your pharmaceutical companies. It's your lobbyists. It's your congressmen and it's insurance companies. We need systemic change. The best way I can explain what happened before opioids and what happened after, and maybe, I don't know that it was something that happened to me that I could have changed, but I can tell you that by the third or the fourth day of me using opioids to treat physical pain was that I felt like a light switch had gone on. And all of a sudden, I was seeing the world in different colors. I was not as socially awkward. I felt more comfortable with myself. We moved from, I moved from treating physical pain to treating emotional pain. But the best way I can explain that to someone who maybe has never used drugs or never had my experience was it was like a light switch. And every time I took a pill, I liked the light coming on. And I can tell you, I know the room I was in, the address I was in when I felt that phenomenon for the very first time. It is now a core memory. That first light switch was pretty cool. The ones that followed for a little while still felt pretty good. But at some point, I did definitely develop a tolerance to the medication itself, which is physical tolerance, not an emotional tolerance, although that does come into play. But I was also experiencing withdrawal symptoms when I would stop taking opioids and know whenever had, and even though I was a nurse and could have done my own research on opioids. Know whenever had a conversation with me about, you know, you really need to be cautious when you're taking these medications and this is why. And if you stop taking them abruptly, this is what you're going to experience. And this was at the height of the fentanyl or the opioid crisis in Massachusetts, which is really was super fascinating to me because the doctors were prescribing, but it was the pharmacist who had recently, the state had recently mandated a prescription drug monitoring program or a PDMP. So the doctors were writing the prescriptions as fast as they could. And I was going to as many doctors as I could to get those prescriptions, but it was only the pharmacist saying, I see you got this filled four days ago by another doctor. Why are you coming to me now? Which it's fascinating to me to look back and to know that at the time, you know, the East Coast was experiencing some of the worst years of their opioid crisis. The physicians were not part of the solution, only the person dispensing the actual drug. So the pharmacist caught on. So I had more trouble filling the prescriptions. What does someone do when they can't get their opioids from a medical professional? They find other ways. So I found other ways and started buying up the street. So I, you know, I purchased at the pharmacy and was also, you know, buying on the street. But I did that for probably a year. And then my sister-in-law at the time died of a drug overdose. Of course, now we don't know what, you know, they didn't do a lot of testing. It was just labeled a drug overdose. So we're not even sure what, what the drug was. So I don't know if it was poisoning of a fentanyl or of something else. But I realized that I didn't want to have that happen to me and to my family. But I also didn't know how to do anything differently than I'd been doing for several years at that point. A lot of that recognition came from just the amount of pills I was consuming a day. Because not only did I have, you know, withdrawals when I stopped using, but the physical tolerance just got more and more extreme. And I still have that tolerance to this day. You know, haven't taken, you know, a non-prescribed opioid, I'll say, you know, in over 13 years. But the physical tolerance really became a problem. And I mean, at the end of my active addiction, I was taking upwards of 100 pills a day because I would take so many opioids. Yeah, that they would make me itch. So I would take Benadryl. And the Benadryl, you know, had a side effect, so I would take another pill. And I would, all of this made me edgy, so I would take another pill. So yeah. I was living in Texas again, and I didn't have any pills. And I couldn't get them as easily here as I was able to in Massachusetts. It was, I didn't have maybe the connections that I needed, or it wasn't in the right neighborhood. I'm not really sure. But I just, I couldn't buy off the streets anymore. I just didn't know who to go to and who to ask. So I was really a lot more dependent on getting it from physicians. And Texas didn't have a prescription drug monitoring program at the time. So the pharmacists weren't wise. The physicians weren't aware. So for a long time, I went, I doctor shopped. And the pharmacists couldn't tell where I was getting any prescription. So I would just go to different pharmacies each day, or, you know, every week or so. But at some point, the doctors started suspecting that I might have a addiction problem, but they wouldn't have that conversation with me. They would just say, I'm sorry, I can't prescribe. So there was no conversation of, you may need to let us help you. There was no conversation of, you could really, you could harm yourself. You know, what you could do as an alternative or how they could help. I was just cut off. And so I called in a prescription to the pharmacy myself. And I got arrested at the pharmacy. So I was arrested at the pharmacy. My family at the time, I don't think had any clue as to how extreme my problem was. I know now that they were suspecting, my mom especially was suspecting that there was, you know, some misuse going on. But she had, I don't think she had any, you know, comprehension of how bad the problem was until she got a phone call from the police. So I was arrested. And the condition of me getting out of jail was that I would go to treatment. So within four or five days, I was in a 28 day residential treatment center. And I had the privilege to do that because my family was able to pay the cash to get me into treatment. A lot of people don't have that privilege. So for the first 16 days, I was only there because that's what my family wanted me to do. And then day 17, my head was really starting to clear. You know, more, I had gotten a lot of the drugs out of my system and I was really able to evaluate the situation, you know, a little more objectively and see that I had a lot of consequences and it was going to take a lot of work to overcome them. And some I probably would never overcome. And so day 17 through 28, I probably got the most use out of the cash that was paid. Being arrested was the best thing that's happened to me, which you don't hear a lot. I get it. I work with law enforcement and every time someone hears me say that for the first time, we have to have a conversation about it. It was quite a few years before I even considered working in the addiction field or the prevention world. My first job out of treatment and after a few months of, you know, stabilization was at Starbucks because they didn't do a background check. So at the time, I didn't want to go back to nursing and I still don't. That doesn't mean that I can't affect change. I can still use my knowledge, but I just didn't think that I wanted to go back. So I worked at Starbucks for three or four years, had another back injury, actually the same back injury that kind of exacerb was reared its ugly head and had to have surgery. So that was interesting. Surgery, you know, after, you know, heavily misusing opioids was a difficult process. But it was when I moved from the Dallas area to San Antonio and I got connected with a 12 step group here, which I'm no longer in the 12 step fellowship, but I think that they can be beneficial. But someone in that group said, we like you should work at a, you would be really great like a treatment center or something. So my first job in this field was at Alpha Home, which is a residential treatment center here in San Antonio. And I realized in the year that I was at Alpha Home, which probably was my hardest job was that I wasn't cut out for treatment to work in treatment, but I was cut out to fit in in this, you know, in this world and, you know, this profession. So I started looking around at other companies and, you know, nonprofits. And at that point we were starting to hear more about peer recovery coaches or, you know, recovery support specialists. And it sounded pretty interesting to me that I would be able to use my lived experience to help others. And who better to get guidance from than someone who's experienced what you're going through. So I applied for a job at Sakata and worked as a recovery coach in the recovery and adult services department for a year. But the work that I was doing was some in the community, you know, going out and meeting partners and doing training with professionals to talk about language we use to educate people about why we say substance use disorders and why that's important and what does the data say. So I really liked the community work. And I really liked then policy, it was policy change. I didn't, I wasn't able to articulate that at the time. But Sakata has a coalitions that work mostly in policy. How do you change a business policy to make things safer? How do you change a bars policy to make things safer? How do you make, how do you change city, county, state or federal policy? So I really thought that that was something that I would be good at doing. And so I, there was an opening in the coalition department and I interviewed and moved departments and that's been five years. The recovery? I wouldn't say that. Not now. I would say that the first one to two years were hard because I was essentially rebuilding an identity and rebuilding a future that was a healthy one. So it was hard because there have to be a lot of changes with friend groups, with communities, with thought process and that is all hard to do. So yes, the first one to two years was hard, but it'll be 14 years in January and I really am not at a place where I count days anymore. I haven't counted days in a long, long time. But now with 13, almost 14 years of perspective, it's not hard at all. It's pretty cool. I get to have relationships with my families that are meaningful. I have the privilege of one of my oldest nieces coming to visit today, or my oldest niece coming to visit today. I have the privilege of taking my youngest niece to the museum that she loves. I get to... You know, I get to care for my aging parents. I would not have had that without recovery.",loaded_from_file,13180,Rebuilding a future,1159.0,30,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00
3KsgiMRp_v4,"My name is Lisa Ann Webb. I am here today to tell a story of hope and recovery for women who are still suffering with a substance use disorder. I was born the youngest of five kids. Had a really for the most part a great childhood. There was some divorce and some alcohol use. I have lots of good memories. You know, grew up on a farm in south Texas, ran around barefooted country girl, rode horses. You know, it was just a, it was a great childhood. I remember big parties at our house every now and then and some negative experiences happening to me during those parties related to being touched inappropriately. You know, as you, you know, as I grew up and some of those drinking patterns were modeled for me through a parent, no fault of his own. He had an illness just like I do. My parents divorced and we moved from Mission, Texas is where I lived originally. My mom and I moved to Corpus Christi. We lived with my grandmother, so it was three generation family, which was such a wonderful thing because I got to really know my grandmother and, and experienced that whole thing. But you know, I left everything I loved, my siblings, all my farm animals, my horse, all that was gone. The life that I knew, you know, was gone. And my mom did the best she could do. And I still saw my dad and I still traveled between, because he still lived in the valley and I still traveled between Corpus and the valley and I had a, you know, he was really engaged in his substance use disorder, alcohol use disorder. So I wish that relationship had been different, you know, earlier in my life, but I would have missed the beauty of the healing that happened later, you know, from when I got into recovery. You know, and long story short, about 15 was when I really started drinking and using on a regular basis and smoking a lot of weed as well. And me and my friends were off to the races. I think at that point, my mother was exhausted from raising five kids and she was just glad when I was home alive at night, I think. There were many signs that there was something going on with me, but there wasn't any intervention from my parents questioned me more. They just, it was amazing to me. Like what, how did that, how did nobody figure it out? There was one adult that knew what was going on with me and that was my stepdad. And he was a Lieutenant Commander in the Navy. So there were little hints of things, red flags here and there in the fringes, right? So and then it didn't help that I was dating a boy that was, got me into using other chemicals, cocaine and ecstasy and acid and those kinds of things. But my, my real love, my true love was alcohol. So that was a really super dysfunctional and sick, abusive relationship that I was in. And finally I came to light. I don't know what happened. And it came to what that relationship taught me was not to take shit off of men and ever again, you know, that, that, that there's boundaries that have been crossed and they're not going to get crossed again. So that was helpful, but also, you know, you fall back into the same behaviors if there's no recovery, if there's no other option, failed out of college. And I just felt like Corpus wasn't really doing it for me. And my sisters both lived in Dallas and I thought, well, let me, let me move to Dallas. All of the same behaviors, the, you know, the night clubs are bigger and brighter and there's more cocaine and, and more trouble to get in in Dallas than I got into it. So that would wake up and not know where I was or who I was sleeping next to and how I got there or what happened. So when you have enough of those mornings, and I think especially just as a woman and then the women that I talked to in recovery, there's a special kind of shame that comes with that. There's a special little bit, the knife goes a little bit deeper with that shame because what kind of woman does over and over again to herself? Because I had that moment of clarity, right? In high school that I wasn't going to allow myself to be abused anymore. Yet I kept the abuse going through my addiction and the shame would build and build and build and it just kept growing and it would multiply with every experience that I had like that. One night in Dallas, or morning, I don't know if it was morning or night, it was probably a night that turned to a morning. I was sure I was going to have a heart attack because I had, I was at a party with my friends, right? And I'm pretty sure somebody put something in my drink because I hadn't taken, I don't remember taking anything that night in addition to all the alcohol I had had. But I felt like my heart, it was some kind of, like I felt like my heart was just going to explode. And I had all these thoughts of like, oh my God, I'm going to die right here, right now in this party with these people. I don't know them. And my mom's going to have to find out that this is what happened to her, to her daughter. And I somehow made it through that. I didn't go to the ER again. You know, God's knocking a little bit harder on my head, you know, my hard head. He's like, hello. You know, you need to pay attention to this. And I just got dressed for work and went to work. Buzzed out of my, I was like, I mean, I'm sure my pupils were the size of, you know, golf ball. I just didn't think anything of it. It was good at Jacksonville, Florida. Right. So my, one of my best friends from high school had moved out there and I thought, well, hell, that's as good a reason as any. And my brother actually lived there. So it wasn't like I didn't have anyone. But I packed my stuff up in my car. It looked like a shoe box. And I had my stuff packed. Like I had enough room for me to sit and drive. That was it. My dad and told him of my wonderful super well thought out plan. I could tell that he had been drinking. I usually didn't like to talk to him after in the evenings because I knew I was not, I was not getting the alcohol free dad at that point. And he told me something to the effect of if you move, don't call me if you ever need anything pretty much. Because wherever you go, there you are. Right. You've heard that saying before. And again, I was like, well, it'll be a fresh start. And all they are all the, I had no idea that there was any, that I should maybe stop drinking or maybe stop smoking weed or shouldn't do cocaine all night. Or I didn't know that. I just, you know, the denial again, piling on the shame. So, you know, got to Jacksonville, which I love that city by the way. I don't know if you've ever been there, but it's a, I love it. It's a great city, but same stuff, different city, different people, same Lisa, lots of, lots of driving under the influence through my whole story. I mean, the whole like, you know, trying to, it's a great city. And the whole like, you know, all that. You know, how I never got a DUI, I really, I really don't know. It was just certainly a matter of time. You know, I don't have a legal history. I don't have a criminal history. It's not because I don't deserve one. It's just, I just, I mean, I'm sure I was like one second from catching charges. I'm sure of it. My sister and I somehow got in a conversation about me coming over to France to be her nanny over there. Here I am, I'm flying to Paris to be my sister's nanny. And you know, she had no idea what was really going on with me, you know, because we don't tell, we don't say, because we don't even know, because we're in such denial that, you know, I think it's great. It's great. It's good. The mask. So I get to Europe, there was some of the same things, but you know, I had a child that I was responsible taking, taking care of. And I believe she saved me. She really gave me a purpose to be a different person. She was my, my light. I would wake up in the morning and I would go into her room to get her out of a crib and she would be standing there just with this joy. Like just nobody was ever happy to, that happy to see me. I was enough removed from my normal influences there that I was able to have some clarity and then things just started moving in a different direction. My other sister had started her journey of recovery. She was doing some group work and you know, some therapeutic work and you know, she would call me and she'd say, Hey, do you remember when this happened or that happened? She was trying to figure out like, what the hell happened? Why, why am I the way I am today? Right? Her behaviors manifested in a different way outwardly than mine did. Mine manifested through an alcohol use disorder and she was my idol. And I thought, uh-oh, if she, if there's something wrong with her, then I'm definitely screwed in this situation. Like it just was a moment of clarity. So she invited me to one of her therapy sessions. I had like a, I don't know, out of body experience. I don't know what happened, but it just all came out. You know, it was just a moment. So I credit my recovery today to my sister for that. Cause she saved my life, my inviting me to that session. So now you're raw. Now you're, now I'm like a throbbing nerve ending is pretty much how it feels to be start raving sober. My denial was so deep that there was no way I was going to go right into a program of recovery for alcoholics. I'm not an alcoholic. I'm not like my dad. I remember going to a psychiatrist and I was really, I was in like long-term withdrawal from alcohol is what the symptoms I was experiencing is that's what it was. Now that I know that today, but he said, that's son of a bitch. He said, maybe you should go to a therapy group for people who are alcoholics. And I was like, what? How dare you? How dare you? Right? And you know, he knew he had my number. I'm pretty sure the first support group meeting I went to, I was, I had, I had been drinking that day and I went and I had like beer on my breath. And so I did some work with the therapist immediately because I had to, it was either that and I, because I was having some suicidal thoughts. I was really more dangerously close to suicide in my addiction than I ever was when I got sober. But I was having a lot of remorse and guilt and shame and, and those feelings are hard to deal with when you're start raving sober and you don't really, when it's just early sobriety, you know, it's just raw. I used to tell people it felt like I drank battery acid. That's how I felt inside. Can you imagine? Can you imagine how that feels like the worst indigestion you've ever felt, but all the time questioning everything I ever thought I knew about anything questioning any truth I ever thought I knew the saving grace I believe is I have a praying mother. And I know that her prayers kept me safe for sure. I was raised with a God. I was raised in a Catholic religion. I'm not Catholic anymore, but I practice Christianity and the veil of that darkness that I shared in that therapy session had lifted, right? And the joy started to show. I was working at, I was a receptionist and, and he came in and it was over. He was so cute and just so cute and so sweet. He's seen me at my, my most vulnerable. We got married in 94. Alcohol has not served me well. Chemicals, they just don't work with me. My body, my genetics, my life experience, my family history that goes back hundreds of years, people having alcohol use disorder. From what little tidbits I can get from, right, from my mom and that from who, what I got from my grandmother, tell me the story about how the, when my grandmother, my great grandmother would borrow the mule for the day, you know, the wagon and the mule that the mule would stop at the liquor store. I'm not making this up. He would stop at the liquor store and she's like, I'm not going to the liquor store. The mule's like, well, I am. Anyway, I don't know if that's, I mean, that's the story I was told, right? And it was like, he, he, he, that's funny. And today it's not really that funny because there's a reason why the mule was stopping at the liquor store. Right. I don't think he was thirsty. Anyway, so I succumbed, right, to, I accepted that I'm an alcoholic. I have an alcohol use disorder. Started working a really solid recovery program with sponsors and friends and, you know, just before this meeting today. I texted my girls. I texted those women. That carried me through my early recovery, my early years of recovery that still carry me today. These relationships that we built in the train wreck of our lives. Right. During the bloody years, because early recovery is, is bloody. It's ugly. It's bloody. It's painful. It's beautiful. It's joyful. It's miraculous. And the main point that I want to get across today, if you don't hear anything else, is that you, you, I'm talking to you. You are worth it. What you did in your addiction is what you did in your addiction. That's not who you are. That's not who God made you to be. It's an illness. Today, these are not tears of pain or shame. These are tears of gratitude and joy for the life that I've been able to lead after I got sober. Went back to school. I settled for psychology because one of the things I've always tried to do is figure people out. That's just my nature. Right. It's one of my gifts. The other thing is recovery is fun. If you're not having fun, you're doing it wrong. I am a board member now. Imagine that. Barefooted in the chicken coop to board member. Barefooted in the chicken coop to board member on Texas Association of Addiction Professionals. How do you, how does that happen? Right. It happens through the vortex we call recovery. So I just felt like maybe we should adopt a child. Right. We haven't gotten pregnant this whole time. Not that we didn't practice, but anyway, I digress. We talked about it and he was like, yeah, maybe we should. And I was like, okay, yeah, let's do that. And so we adopted a child. We adopted a baby girl from China. The process of that is like almost like it's, I call it a birth on paper because it's grueling. FBI background, state background check, fingerprints, blood work. I mean the whole nine. And it happened to be that their requirement, whatever that means, is that you be sober 10 years and I had just passed my 10 year birthday. I met, I met the requirement. So we went to China in 2005, August of 2005 to get our baby. We went to China. I got to walk on the Great Wall. But I got to do that because I'm a sober woman. My dad had been doing some recovery of his own in his own way. And he saw my grades and he paid for the rest of my school. And he said, I'm so proud of you. He was in his own recovery in some ways. Our relationship started to change and when it came time, I made amends to him for blaming him for everything that bad that had happened in my life, for accusing him of making me an alcoholic. Any relationship between me and him was a big thing. Any relationship can heal. In this particular instance with my dad, we were, we had 100% healing happen because of the work I did, but also because of the work he did. Today, our daughter is 18 years old. She's publishing a research paper on biomechanical engineering. She's my heart. To the women in recovery, to the women who are suffering, allow yourself to be vulnerable enough to ask for help. It's my experience through being a treatment professional for 14 years that our loved ones have a very significant part to play in helping us in the path to recovery. Allow your loved ones to love you and know that they see things you don't. Even today, I still have shame coming up right now, right? But my warrior inside of me says not today because I'm a warrior for this disease. And so are you. You just haven't found your armor yet. So find your armor. So find your armor.",loaded_from_file,15737,THE JOURNEY From Addiction to Recovery - Lisa's Story,1443.0,37,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00
4K1Sz0vcJEI,"I'm here because I want to make a difference. I can't say that I've ever used fentanyl, but heroin was my addiction, and I've been in recovery for seven years. What would you say to someone who's just starting out in recovery? In recovery, I would tell them, don't give up before the miracle happens. The miracle. Yeah. The fire. The fire for recovery. I want to help others. I got clean in prison, but my last use was also in prison as well. When I got out, I went to a recovery house in Columbia and started to see that other people, just as bad as myself, they were killing it, and they were joyful, and they were helping others, and they had a fire about them. I wanted that. My first heroin use was about 16 years old in Cleveland, Ohio, where I'm from. We were doing oxy-cottons, and we didn't have any oxy-cottons, so we did some heroin. That's where my addiction just took off. So there's no going back? No, not after that. How long did that go on? Well, I'm 45, and I've been clean for seven years, so it went on for a couple of decades. In and out of prison, homeless, overdoses, funerals, mental wards, all of it. What helped? The best motivator for anybody to get clean and sober is pain, because you're not going to change if something's going good. You're not going to change if you don't have to. The best motivator for me was pain, shame, and guilt, sitting in a prison cell. My family was done with me, ashamed of me, and I had nobody and no word of turn. That was my motivator to change. When I came home from prison, my sister gave me a chance. Both my parents were passed away. All my grandparents were, but the most important people, my sister, my niece, they started to give me another chance. I started going to recovery meetings and building a family there. I started going to church and building a family there. Building relationships. When you think about addiction, when you think about recovery, I think about what the opposite of recovery is. I think that that is not being connected. I think that's the opposite of addiction. I got connected every way. Like I said, recovery meetings, church, community. I became a peer specialist working with people that are in active addiction or just got clean. I found my niche. What do you do now? You're paying it forward, it sounds like. Paying it forward. Sometimes it sounds really glorious and fun. I'm helping people get cleanest over. When you think of addicts and early recovery, it's not fun. Just because we pulled a needle out of our arm or stopped smoking a bubble or whatever your choice is, it doesn't mean that all your problems go away instantly. All that means is you're not getting high. The real challenge is now, now that you have to deal with yourself and all your trauma and yucky crap that you brought into recovery with you. Many early recovery people, their statistics are not great, but I get those twos and threes and four people that I sit back at the end of the day like, yep, this is why I do what I do. That's the cool part. Rehab, that's a really expensive way to get free information. That's not a popular opinion, but it's the truth. All those resources are out here in the community as well. I do believe that it serves a purpose, it helps them get to dope out of their system. The relapses, maybe it's me being cynical from doing this for a few years now. I expect people to relapse. It makes me extremely joyful when they don't. If I expect them to relapse, it doesn't take away from any effort I put into how I serve them or help them or anything like that, but it's okay. I get it. The most unfortunate thing these days is that when it comes to fentanyl, another recovery is not guaranteed. People are dying left and right, so relapse is not okay. I'll never sit here and be like, well, it's okay. I won't co-sign that. I won't. Relapse is not okay, but it's expected. The last thing that I always remind my guys is that these are not breaking bad characters in a surgical place making this stuff. These are sometimes foreign, sometimes whoever, but they're out here in these woods with stills and all this other stuff, and it's nasty, and there's no method to it. These are not scientists making these pills. Again, that's the scary part. A lot of times they're just junkies trying to get high too. Just because it says Adderall or Morphine or whatever on the pill, that doesn't mean nothing. That means that they bought that pill press off of eBay. What's the big things that people that are in recovery really need to know? What's the things that they don't know? Something I always tell people is get in the middle of the boat. If you're a fellowship person such as myself, you go to as many meetings as possible and you learn how to serve, and you build a support network. If you're not a fellowship person, you better find something to believe in. You better find something to fill that void because us as drug addicts and alcoholics, we live and breathe it. Our addiction is everything. My addiction was the most jealous thing ever. I wasn't allowed to have family, girlfriend, job, none of that. Just my addiction. When you take that addiction out of your life, it leaves a gaping wound, like a void. You need to fill it with something. God, recovery, something positive. Most of us, we're not just addicted to the dope. We're addicted to the life. Got to fill that void. I'm an NA person. I found my family there. I found people like me, knuckleheads, just like myself, that gave me something to do. They held me accountable. They didn't cosign my bullshit anymore. They wouldn't just accept any old answer. They made me really start taking a look at myself and holding me accountable, gave me stuff to do, gave me responsibilities, made me feel a part of their life. That's the biggest thing because we don't use drugs, fentanyl, whatever because we feel great about ourselves. You know what I'm saying? We use to hide this trauma and these feelings. When we start to experience a little recovery and people start accepting us, it means the world. It really does.",loaded_from_file,6081,Mike's Story - The Fires of Recovery,596.0,1,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00
5b92hK8P1OA,"It started with drinking first as a teenager. Yes, as a teenager it started with drinking and over the years it progressed and got worse. I started drinking at, I was about maybe 13 years old. I know that I was in high school when I first started drinking. I was very curious. I wanted to see what it tastes like and how it made me feel. A lot of my friends were drinking so I wanted to fit in. And this is what I'm supposed to do. Everybody else doing it so I just joined in with the crowd. It became a problem and it made problems worse. It didn't help anything. Gradually progressed to percocets just to kind of have fun with the drinking. And it became something that I needed just to wake up in the morning. And just to get up and get my kids ready for school, my body was telling me that I need this just in order to make it that day. Percocets was more in my adult years. I had already had my oldest two children. They would give me percocets after having a baby for the pain. And the feeling that I got from it made me feel unstoppable. I felt as though if I took this percocet I could get all the laundry done. I could take care of my baby. I could run to the grocery store. I had that feeling of, alright, this is something that's going to help me with my responsibilities. But of course I later learned that that was not true. It becomes a crutch. It becomes where I felt as though I need this in order to just get through the day. I became dependent on the drug. So for me it was a constant chase. It was a constant chase of the feeling that it gave me. And then I wanted to also avoid the withdrawal pains. I didn't want to have to go through feeling sick. I didn't want to have to go through the aches and the pains that came with not having it in my body. My body became immune to it. It was as though this is something mentally I need and physically I need this drug. Honestly, I have been in denial for such a long time. My best friend was the one that brought it to my attention and even then I was still in denial. But I still was in denial at the time. I still was in denial at the time. I still wanted what I wanted and that was to get out. I went through a phase in my life where things was constantly tumbling. My lights got cut off. I lost my apartment. It was hard for me to really take care of my children. I had to go to my best friend and ask her if we could come and stay with her, me and four children. And even then I still lied while they're having her think I'm getting myself together and I'm really not. I still was manipulative because I'm still in my addiction at the time. So like I said, it was a moment when she said, Keonja, this is a real problem. Because me in my mind at the time, I'm thinking this is normal. This is what I'm supposed to do. This is what I've been doing. So that was the moment where she suggested, Keonja, you need to go to Kentucky. You need to get in rehab. So Kentucky has a lot of people from our hometown, which is Richmond, that have went there and been successful in recovery. There's a really big support group there. And we've seen success. And it's also miles and miles away from Virginia. So the point of moving away from the area that you're used to and the people that you know was a part of the suggestion of going to Kentucky to kind of start over. And it actually was helpful, very helpful. It was hard to do in the beginning. And as I went through my process, but it was the best decision I ever made in my life. I believe it stuck because I had finally made up in my mind that that's not the life I want to live. I finally made up in my mind that I was tired. I was sick and tired of being sick and tired. I had finally made up in my mind that I want better for myself and my children. So even though I gained a lot of knowledge while being there, I also applied that knowledge. And that's what made it makes it powerful. I had to actually come to the point where, okay, I'm here in the rehab program miles and miles away from my kids and family. Clearly, I don't know a thing about life and how to live. So I had to humble myself. I had to listen to other people that had been there long before me and that were actually walking, walking it out. So I had to shut up, be quiet and take suggestions. I had to be open to that. I had to go into it in a mindset of knowing that, hey, I don't know everything because see, I always thought I knew everything. But I had to get real with me first. Keonjoo, you don't know all there is about how to live life and live it on life terms. So I had to listen. I'm still taking it one moment at a time. I'm taking it one step at a time. And the reason I say that because it's not a walk in the park. Just because God has delivered me from drugs and alcohol does not mean problems does not still arise. They do. But it's my faith that keeps me going. I'm still taking it one moment at a time.",loaded_from_file,4908,Keondra's Story - I Had to Listen,531.0,4,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00
5R9j4JjQANE,"I Am an alcoholic and an addict I have been in recovery since February 24th of 2023 I Am hoping that just sharing my story will encourage others that recover is possible Yeah, on Saturday, it'll be 18 months And in that time I have been able to Get a lot back that I had previously lost I Have reestablished a connection with my younger sister and her family My mom and I are closer than ever But the catalyst to getting sober for me was unfortunately the death of my father He died on May 8th of 2022 and Before he passed away. I had decided that I wanted to Try to get sober I Signed up for outpatient services at a recovery center here in town and I did successfully complete that and I quit drinking alcohol I haven't had a drink since April 24th of 2022 But in my grief I discovered that I Was not just an alcoholic I would pretty much use anything that I could to Try to tamp down those feelings and grief is an incredibly uncomfortable feeling My dad and I had been very close he Was a pastor here in town he was always just the most honest and understanding man and So I was closer to him than I was to the other members of my family And losing him was really hard so You know because I knew he was sick was when I really started trying but Like I said grief can do some Really hard things to us I Had still been smoking marijuana a lot of people call it marijuana maintenance, you know for some people it is helpful, but for me it It just made things worse it made the anxiety worse it made the depression worse and I Didn't understand that at the time And eventually I started using other substances Because I just figured well, it's not drinking right? so The substance that I had the hardest time with is you know one of the dumbest that you could do I Started huffing air duster Because I knew that it Wasn't a lasting high and I thought well, you know, it's not an illicit substance but What it was doing to my body and my brain was Probably worse than the drinking I Ended up, you know really Doing a lot of damage to My body my brain and you know myself esteem I knew what I was doing was incredibly stupid But at the time it felt like the only way to escape the grief that I was feeling and It was easy to get I Ended up getting to a point with that where I was making myself sick. I was passing out it causes a lack of oxygen to the brain and There are chemicals in it that can potentially do you know damage your lungs among other things and I was To a point with it where my roommates at the time were afraid they were gonna find me dead so In order to You know Keep my job keep my living situation and keep my family I Signed myself up for outpatient services a second time It was actually the third overall but this was the time that I really took it seriously I went to a place here in town called mirror, Inc. They have them across Kansas, but the one here in Topeka was the one that Did the trick for me? I guess so to speak I Had an incredible counselor who tailored my recovery plan to my interests and What interested me was learning about why our Bodies and brains, you know want and crave these substances and what it does to us and I Think understanding and learning about those things really helped me So a lot of my homework was watching documentaries But I also just I Started taking notes I started really investing, you know more time in the hows the wise and the what's and Something clicked and stuck and Now that I do know Exactly what I was doing to myself looking back. It's scary But at the time that was all I knew I had been drinking and using different substances since I was about 13 years old It started when my family was living in Oklahoma City We moved back to Topeka. I was born here, but we moved back to Topeka around the time that I was 16 and For my generation drugs are everywhere They're easy to get it's scarier all the time I Have been drinking heavily essentially since I started drinking I Was somebody who drank to escape Or to fit in, you know, I always had to keep up with everybody and So that was a point of contention in my family and You know, my parents really tried they tried to understand they tried to get me help they You know, they knew that something was going on but Nobody is ready to see it until they're ready Nobody can get you sober except you The heavy drinking was I think the hardest because For a long time, you know, I knew that I was doing it as an escape, but I wasn't Looking at why I needed to escape And that's something that in my adult life I have focused more on Recovery for me does include a lot of therapy I I Didn't want to see it as a teenager though who wants to you know have a problem who wants to admit that they're different Whether it's substance use disorder a diagnosable mental health disorder, you know, nobody there's a stigma surrounding all of those things and And at the same time there's a bunch of people around you in school who are doing similar things Right as a kind of endorsement. Yeah of doing it and you know going from Everybody else doing it because it's cool to experiment in school. I went into the surface industry Where drinking and drug use are encouraged? It doesn't matter what kind of day you've had what kind of shift you've had you drink about it and There's also a lot of access to other substances In my 20s, especially it was drinking and cocaine I am very grateful that at the time Fentanyl wasn't as big a thing as it is now Because with the way that I was drinking and using I could have easily fallen victim to something like that It really started just as experimentation, you know in Middle school that was mostly just smoking pot in high school. It was drinking at parties And then it was harder drugs I Tried meth for the first time when I was 15 years old and It was because people had it I Trusted them. I wanted to try it So we're winding a little bit when I was 14. I was sexually assaulted and I think that The trauma from that really affected the Experimentation it went from I'll try it to Let's do it all the time because what could hurt me that didn't already hurt me and My parents knew that something was going on, but I didn't tell them for about a year that anything had happened and When they did find out It was after a particularly big explosion of emotion That was due to drinking And like I said my parents always tried you know, but The help that they wanted to get me I wasn't ready to take I was too angry at the world to do anything about it yet I'm still working on getting past that still angry at the world a little bit More so the trauma of that specific event. I'm less angry at the world and I am more angry at myself for Not Trying when help was offered. I Think a lot of addicts in recovery Have ourselves first on our resentment lists I Think it's a very personal thing if you prefer to refer to yourself as someone with substance use disorder That's all right. If you prefer to call yourself an addict. That's all right Recovery is personal and how we label ourselves as personal I Really appreciate people who have dedicated their lives to learning about addicts and substance use disorder and working with them, but Unless you have that lived experience It's not really up to you what we call ourselves Recovery is possible It's a lot of hard work There are days where You feel like why am I doing this? but It's really powerful to know that you can get through those days without using The life that I live now is The life that I've always wanted but I Was too afraid of feeling and doing the inner work for so long that It's a little postponed But just because it's postponed doesn't mean it's not beautiful Seeing The change in myself has been incredible when I started my recovery journey I started journaling and Looking back at the things that I used to write about and You know how that has evolved is Sort of like this tangible proof of life that I can hold in my hand and see You know just how far I have come in this process You",loaded_from_file,8019,Claire's Story - The change in myself...,900.0,18,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00
5WomfsgXMJg,"Way back in probably 2009, it started out with weed and alcohol. Most people don't frown on that too much, but then it makes you a little bit more susceptible to being open to trying more things, harder things. Back then it was in and out of jail and group homes because it was just trouble after trouble after trouble. We moved down to Texas in a small town called Eustace. That was at about 14. It was a small town of probably just a couple hundred people. I had my best friend down there and we smoked weed every day. All day that was our thing. One day we got a hold of some acid. We did the acid. We were told that if you smoke some meth with the acid that it gives you a better time. It gives you a better ride. We did it. At the time we thought it was great. It was fun. It was awesome. We lived in the middle of the country so we were literally just doing whatever we wanted. From that point on we were always trying to get more and more meth. It was just always. It was extremely hard to get down there, but once we found a way to get it it was kind of just balls to the wall getting high every day. We were both in high school at the time. Very shortly after the steady meth use started we both got expelled. Mind you we were in a school that was K through 12 maybe a thousand students maybe. We got expelled and then went even further because now we don't have really any responsibility. At 16 you don't have school and what not it's what it is. We got pretty far off there. I lost my grandpa in February of 2015 and he lived up here. He was in a nursing home. Whenever he passed we came up here for the funeral. I went off the deep end up here. I didn't even go back to Texas. I was on probation in Texas, didn't go back. I ended up getting sent to KJCC here in Topeka and whenever that happened I got out right before my 18th birthday so Texas ended up dropping all their stuff because I already went to prison up here and stuff for it. I ended up doing 18 months in KJCC for stealing cars and running from the cops and burglaries. Or they dropped theirs. I ended up getting out, went to an independent living in Lawrence which was a whole another fiasco. I was clean for a few months. Then we started doing coke which led back to the meth which then led back to stealing cars again. I got kicked out of there and I got removed from there by my probation officer and got sent to a group home which was a little bit more restrictive than the independent living. The group home things kind of picked up a little bit. I was doing better. I had a job. I was working five days a week. I was there for like three months and I ended up getting into a fight and got kicked out of there. So then I went back to the Wyandotte County JDC and they sent me back to KJCC for three months. Three months at that time because I was still, actually I went to the county jail at that point. I was over 18. But I was still on juvenile stuff so they sent me back to KJCC. I got out after doing three months. This brings us up to the end of 2016, beginning of 2017. I went to live with my grandma and I did pretty well for a little while. It lasted for about six months roughly. I was working at waste management. I was a mechanic at the recycling plant so I had a really fun, interesting job. It was always something new. It gave me something to kind of look forward to. I was part-time at Johnson County Community College for automotive tech. It seems like once the summer break hit, it just all hell broke loose again. It was very slow because I was trying to not lose everything. I thought that there was a way to do it and not get caught, not get in trouble. This brings us to mid-17. And finally, I lost my job. My juvenile probation violated, went to the county and the juvenile court gave me an unsuccessful discharge. I looked at that as a hell yeah at the time. I don't even got to sit in jail no more. I was done with all that. I thought it was free game. And that's where it really started at. That's where it went south very quick. Once it started with the meth that probably was pulling me back, I know that I'm going to drink a little in junkie. It was fun running from the cops. That whole thrill, it was a different experience that was hard to find elsewhere. Now I got my alternatives, but back then it was just nonstop trying to essentially just chase the adrenaline high at the same time as I was chasing my addiction high. So it was kind of like they were just one and the same at that point. When I was in mid-17, I was now an adult in the state size. I was at an even lower point in the addiction. So I was going harder and harder, still and more, running from the cops literally every day. For me and a group of friends, we would just run, run, run. It was almost like we were playing cat and mouse. We would go looking for trouble because we thought it was fun. And I want to say it was July 9th. So the night of my birthday, July 8th, we decided we needed to go make some money. We can party real hard that weekend. We can all have all the friends over and enjoy it. So we went out all night long stilling stuff, stilling cars. Well by come morning, it's the 9th. It was about 7, 8 in the morning. We had finally wrapped up and we were heading back home, which was to Kansas City from I think like Togonoxy maybe. And on the way back, the highway patrol tried to pull over one of us. We were in two cars and he went around me and tried to get my buddy. Well neither one of us could let the other get caught up. So he ended up having a flat jumped into the truck and we all ended up being in one vehicle running. And we got away on foot and little did we know a couple weeks later I had a warrant out. And I found out because they finally caught me one time and they told me. So I spent the next four months in jail and anybody that's been to jail kind of knows it's like a majority of them people, them guys, girls, whatever, you know, they're just, I feel like a majority of them are just plotting their next big plan or you know can't wait to get out and get high and I was doing all of it. I did think that I could be smarter and slicker and get away with everything. Everybody does. And in December they let me out on adult probation. And that was pretty much the one chance I got. And literally that night I had a new stolen car and surprisingly I did not get high for I think like two or three days. But then I was getting high. And that lasted for a grand total of 18 days. And we had a pretty big incident where the cops were called because they thought we were shooting at cars but we were not. We were perched up on the side of the high, like where billboards are up on the side of the highways. And a passerby thought we were shooting at the highway. We were not. We were in a good spot to shoot we thought. And so the cops swarmed it pretty heavy. We ran, got away and a couple hours later were chased again and they chased us until they caught us that time. They took me in and I was charged with guns, stolen property, burglary, fleeing and alluding, assault on the L.E.O. Over three different counties. And that was Wyandotte, Johnson and Clay. When I went in I wasn't looking at it too serious. You can get your hands on things really anywhere, jail, prison or whatever. And I was still chasing that addiction every time I got a chance. Well, about a year later I found out how much time I got. It ended up being a grand total of 77 months and I did 60 months of it. And all the way up until my two and a half year mark I still had plans and I was still doing math in prison. I was just going to use every way that I got caught to not get caught again. And I ended up being in there with a friend of mine. He grew up with my cousin. He did the same stuff that we did and he battled the same addiction and he was coincidentally my vent partner. When I was next to you usually you'll be chatting it up with them all night because you're in your cell all the time. Well he ended up being out one night still in cars and he got jumped by three guys trying to protect their property and he ended up shooting them. He got I think 18 years for it. His story and what happened to him made me open my eyes because there was many times that that could have been me and that 60 months that I ended up doing could have been 18 years. And his mom had to deal with it. His daughter, she was just a little girl. She's going to be a grown woman probably married with her own family by the time he gets out. And all the months and months and months of me and him talking is what made me know something had to change. But I also knew I had to find something to help me change. Well my personal opinion is one of the big motivators for us doing crime and selling drugs and stuff like that is money. So I had to think of something that's felon friendly now because I got numerous felonies. Something that doesn't take years and years of trade or schoolwork and I had about another year to think about that. And I ran into another guy that was a truck driver and he's the second person who made a pretty big impact on me. And he gave me every bit of information that I needed to get into trucking school, to get into it and not have to pay for it. Different programs that the states offer, different companies that will train you. He gave me a list of all the felon friendly trucking companies and the KC Metro. But he gave me two pages front and back worth of information. And we spent hours and hours talking and he didn't have to do that. Well whenever I got back to prison from the county jail visit which is where I met him I started looking into some of the programs that he was talking about and doing some research. And in the meantime I got a minimum wage job in prison where I could make real money, not just 60 cents an hour. So I got that job making nine bucks an hour and I just started saving up money because I needed to be prepared to pay for my school if I had to. By this point I'm committed like there's nothing else I'm doing. I'm going to CDL school. I'm going to get my CDL. I'm going to start driving to Simi's. I'm going to make it happen. And I ended up meeting closer to my release with the, I think they're called reentry if I remember right. And they start getting you ready to go back out into the community. And talking with them they put me in touch with another lady. So a whole another program I didn't know about that helped as well. She put me in touch with the other program that does what I needed. So by the time I got out I had like 14 or 15 months worth of saving money up to make sure I could pay for school. And then I get out to find out that Kansas works paid for the school. So within three weeks I was at my first day of school, three weeks getting out. I was starting my first day of CDL school. It's a four week school. And we're talking about 2022 at this point. I got out August, August 3rd I believe. And I started my job in October and been there ever since. I'm still a firm believer that money is a big motivator for us to go back to the crime. But as far as the drug side of it I think it's support. Having the family and friends that are a positive impact. And I would always push back then I would always push the family away like no you're crazy I'm not doing drugs I'm not getting high I would stay away. You don't know what you're talking about you're crazy. And I learned to kind of even if I don't want to hear it embrace those concerns even now you know grab all I'll tell her something about work and she's like well just deal with it you know it's really not a big deal well back then I'd have been like no you know screw that it is a big deal. So I've learned to kind of embrace the family connection side of it and embrace their support instead of kind of just kicking it away. And then one of the other big things I did was everybody who I used to talk to unless I knew for a fact that they were doing better I didn't I didn't reach out. To this day I still get from requests and message requests from old friends and I love the hell out of them but you're still doing the bullshit. And you know I'm past all that you know I got I've started building a life up for myself and I'm working on a pretty good career and you know planning on different things and I don't have time for distractions. And as much as I love them you know friends family alike I actually when I got out of prison I wasn't talking to my dad for a few months and I love my dad he struggled with addiction all his from like teens all the way through now and he was doing good whenever I got out or he started doing good again shortly after I got out and I gave him a chance and I told him I said you know I'm just letting you know I don't have I don't have time for it and just like I've cut the whole rest of your side of the family off I'll cut you off if I have to you know I gotta I gotta protect me at this point. And there for about a year we had a decent relationship and then six or nine months ago I started getting some bad vibes from them and then my suspicions were more or less confirmed with some actions that I was seeing out of them and I don't talk to them no more and it's it's tough you know I love them you know he he didn't raise me by any means but that's still dad you know you still you still have love for all your family and I cut him off and that was a tough one to cut off and I just I can't risk you know I got out and I had multiple nieces and nephews born you know five years is a long time both of my sisters got married well two of my sisters I got many many siblings but two of my sisters were married and you know I was sad that I missed all of that you know to I just seen one of my nephews born and I got five so that's pretty tough you know just knowing all the stuff you miss out on because of all that and that's then just see and whenever I go see them the the look in their eyes you know the the happiness on their face it keeps me steering clear but it's it's not always easy it's not but the support that you bring around you can can make it very easy it can make it possible because all of us in addiction you push it you don't you don't want to hear that shit you don't want to you don't want to be told this or that you know you want everybody to think they're the crazy ones and you're not and you know you want everybody to study your business and mind their own business and once you learn to first off you got to want change but if you want change you got to learn to embrace all of that it's annoying sometimes it is sometimes it feels overbearing but it's it's all because it's love you know it's um hell loves overbearing sometimes you know it just it's what it is but your your support system will care about you whether that be family friends siblings husband wife boyfriend girlfriend kids you know that's your support system will love you and care about you and help you help you find an exit you know there's if I would have wanted to help and I would have leaned into my family for the help they would have helped me get it but I was adamant that there wasn't a problem you know like I said to all the way up until two and a half years into my my prison sentence I I didn't think I needed help I didn't and I finally I got off probation last December one year out out of prison I bought my house been remodeling it so it's it's been a little chaotic but I stay busy with stuff like that now when I need a little bit of an adrenaline release I jump on my motorcycle and just fly down the highway this time has been so different than anything else I've experienced ever in life I mean I've been on two vacations now since I've been out and my last vacation was when I was a kid maybe like eight years old before that and that's like that'll make you feel good you know that'll keep you going in the right direction and works really good you know there's always pros and cons but overall I do like it I do I do wish there was a little bit more excitement involved because it's just the same thing you're just driving driving you know delivering and because I delivered a grocery or I delivered to restaurants so there's really it's the same thing every time every single time but it is it is a really easy job for me and it keeps me it's very fast paced because you want to get back home and I like that and then yeah I just I'm pretty happy with where we're at now I'm pretty pretty excited about it pretty pretty excited to see what even the next two years have because I didn't get sober until 2019 even though I went into prison in 2017 and and so we're five years in and it's gonna be interesting to see what the next five years ever come we have every time I would go to jail my mom would be crying and crying and she went and seen me in county and she just broke down crying and she's like I I just would or I just hope this is your last time coming through here and once you get to a certain point of being in addiction you're just like really numb so you know you might feel some emotion you know you might you might laugh you might cry you might get mad but overall you're kind of numb and when I seen my mom break down crying like that and mind you I had seen it for years because I'm her only son so she's always been I've almost been perfect in her eyes you know all my life but um seeing her break down crying like that it just it really really hurt and then my grandpa he died you know he didn't never see anything different other than me going in and out of jail and JDC at that point and me and my cousin and our friends smoking weed out on the porch you know just that's all he ever seen and grandma you know she's getting older now grandpa died at 93 um that was my dad's dad my mom's mom is the only one I got left now and um um she is 67 and I don't want her to go out you know seeing me oh well TJ was up to the same shit you know he just he's never gonna change you know I want her to I want her to rest easy knowing that TJ is definitely doing something different

6cvmIM0kOh8,"For me working all 12 steps and sponsoring people today is really a whole lifestyle change. Being a service to others in any way I can and it's the career path I took now and it's been really rewarding. Just one of the main reasons that keep me sober today is being a service to others. So the things I get to do in my community now is I work with a non-profit agency and I do parent education and parent leadership. So being me in a person in recovery is I reach out to the people I can help the most who can relate to my stories and our parents, you know, the people that have kids involved and really get to reach out to them and make a difference in their lives. I had an opiate issue for almost 15 years when I first started doing it. I was about 14 and that's when it wasn't an issue but it gradually got worse and worse. One of the big things that got me sober was actually surviving an overdose on fentanyl. That's when I knew that things, I was Narcan by a friend who isn't here today now because of an overdose and I mean he saved my life that day and that's when I knew that I had to change it for my kids and myself because I wanted to be the father that they needed. And back then it seemed like, you know, just grabbing stuff out of your parents' cabinets or buying them at school and stuff like that but I was prescribed Adderall at a young age in a fetamines and it's something I realized I could trade for what I wanted because I found my love in opiates instead of, you know, that and it just kind of blend over to that line and it wasn't really an issue. High school was the weed, the drinking and the pills really, you know, and started, you know, dabbling in psychedelics and stuff like that but nothing seemed like an issue at the time, you know, and I got married at a young age right out of high school and that's when the whole journey with synthetic opioids at least really took off and I don't know whether, when the withdrawal started or when it really started going downhill is just, I can't place it but it turned into a problem, a huge problem in my life. It's somewhere in the line of when I started distributing, when I had them around me a lot more I'd say and that's when I had more access and it became more of a problem where I, you know, I didn't have to pay for them or have to go out and do things, you know, and it's just, it was a slope that went downhill pretty fast. I've always been a true alcoholic too and it's it runs in my family also with addiction and mental health and stuff so those were all huge things and of course getting in trouble with the law. I remember I failed probation just because of substance use. I remember going in there and I would admit to the opiate use because he knew that I was an opiate addict but that was just to keep him from finding, you know, the other three or four drugs I was on at the time also because a lot of it was couch surfing at the time and just following that road. It eventually led me to prison and being released from prison I maxed my time out and the year post release I'd say within two days of release, you know, I was sticking needles in my arm again and it was immediately downhill for a couple months and I broke down to my parole officer and I was like I need help. I can't stop and they were really good about it and put me in treatment here and you know that time I survived a good 18 months over. I am a huge advocate for Oxford houses too. I've been in Oxford houses probably five years and all. This time I stayed a good 16 months I believe that time and it eventually came down to wanting visits with my older daughter and she was born in that marriage and I got divorced from that marriage and I didn't have a safe place for her to be while I was working on my recovery so I ended up moving in with a friend and I told myself I was a normal drinker that I could have just one and be fine and all that and about three years later I crawled back and I was having alcohol related withdrawal seizures and every time I really wasn't dabbling into opiates but every time I tried to pick one up I would overdose and it happened twice before I really realized that this isn't the same anymore. It looked the same as it used to be but it just fell out immediately and stopped breathing and it's like that's not how it used to be and it's just not worth it no more. And unfortunately it was a friend that ended up passing from fentanyl overdose who saved me. He died about it's almost two years on those two close friends I lost. My best friend since I was five he died about 18 months ago from a fentanyl overdose and it's just really something that I tried to dive into harm reduction right then and get the word out because I was tired of losing people. I ended up putting him on my arm and says no story should end too soon. Purple ribbon and everything and I just wanted to take him on this journey with me too and I mean being around people that are losing kids to it and friends and family members it's just it's overwhelming sometimes. So the crazy thing is I got sober during COVID which was a really weird time and like the opposite of what everyone else is doing. But yeah almost dying was really that turning point I did it wasn't on probation or anything at the time. It had somebody telling me to do this. I was just scared for my life. I ended up checking in I had to do a medical detox because the way I was drinking. But with COVID they would set the bed date so far out. It'd be a month until you can get into a bed after the detox. The first time I went to detox it was you know I started drinking again because that bed date and I showed up at that bed date you know drunk and they didn't let me in. So I am so grateful for my parents today because after the second time I went to detox. I'll call it like a passive kidnapping. They took me into their house and you know took my keys to my car everything and would transport me to work just so I could stay good until that time. Until that new bed date and that might have changed everything for me. I did a 30 day program here in Topeka. Immediately went back to Oxford House. So I've been in recovery quite a few times at this point and the one thing I noticed that I didn't do was dive into the program of Alcoholics Anonymous and work these steps. So that's just something that I put in my head like hey I got a really good sponsor. I'm going to actually try to do it this time and he immediately put me into service work. So like I said last time I couldn't have any more safe to raise my kid while working in program recovery which led me into this opportunity of opening the first men in Children's Oxford House in Topeka. So this gave us a safe place to me and a couple dads to bring our kids over there, live in an Oxford House like other people do but also have our kids and it really set off this whole journey. I was there for over a year in which I opened up another one, the Buchanan House, the second men in Children's House in Topeka. So this whole time I took on my, she was probably two at the time, my little daughter Ava and I took her on full time while working in program and everything and working and doing the whole thing. It's just been such a blessing to watch these other dads thrive in these conditions. A lot of them want to be the parents they can be but they just don't know how to safely go about it in these homes or just a safe place to do that. It's been a recovery process plus you can have your kids around you. The other houses will allow that but we work with companies, not companies but organizations like KVC and state agencies to bring kids home from foster cares using these homes to reintegrate them and it's just been nonstop fulfilling this. I don't know how to describe it. It's really what led me into the career I have right now. I get to do parent education in my community and like I said it's a lot of the people I reach out to are the people that have been incarcerated or have mental health problems, have kids in state custody, dealing with substance abuse, just everything I can relate to. The courses I get around in the community now too because I learn off of fathers every day. I don't know at all. I don't think anybody's got parenting down. It's a new journey every day and it's being around especially the fatherhood stuff I do out here. It's being around other people that are going through it because a lot of it can be scary. Just having someone to talk to about it means the world to people. You don't have to be defined by your past. You can still make a difference out here. It took me, I had to work on myself for a long time to be able to figure out who I am and be able to move forward with my life and I do attribute that a lot to the 12 steps. Being able to sponsor people now, being a service to others, it's just a huge thing that opens doors and it's hard to describe it but there's just signs all around me that show me where I need to be and what I need to be doing. There's got to be this kind of, like in the course of your recovery journey, there's got to be these awesome little discoveries that happen fairly regularly where you see yourself, oh wow, that's better now. The promises of the program, it can be the smallest things at first like, hey I just got my driver's license back, all these, really learning how to adult again, you know, it's like I wasted so much time doing what I wanted instead of what was good for me and those small successes like that, like getting a visit with your kid after you haven't seen them in months, you know, or a driver's license, getting your social security car back, getting your first job while in recovery, it's just the promises of the program and they just keep building and building and repealing themselves.",loaded_from_file,9814,Nathan's Story - In Service to Others,832.0,16,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00

Yes, you can I'm living proof. It took me eight plus years to get it right at 33 I'm in recovery August 6th of 2024 was the day I surrendered to my higher power as I collapsed on my knees and my brother Felix is Living room That's when I surrendered and I said enough is enough. It's time to Speak upon my recovery journey and my reasons Which I don't have no reasons many people say they have reasons But at the end of the day, the only reason is to make sure that you Get it right Growing up wasn't easy for me. I was given a role a Role that obviously not many People No, I was given a role to be a mother at such a young age to my little sisters So I never believed in love until I met my beloved husband He showed me what it is to be honest and loyal and to be a go-getter Not just that he opened up my My world Into a whole other dimension that I never thought that I would be able to experience My beloved late husband Christopher Michael Simon Tim, that's where it all began a Man of honor integrity Loyalty honesty and respect Military proudly served and continue serving as well The space operations engineer for lean quest Deeply in love it was one of those Love stories where you just like wake up and then it's there and then you fall asleep and then it's gone Today is my daughter Olivia's birthday our daughter Olivia's birthday I Want more honor than to do this on her birthday Honoring her father and honoring her This beautiful angel named Olivia May Simon Tim Mookie always wanted a daughter and when we met at that time I had Janineke and Delilah and so He was like they're they're a piece of me now Michael never judged Michael never made anybody feel less if he had $20 in his pocket That to him was just a piece of paper he said He loved his military experience and he always you know Didn't really catch on why there were so much jokes about different You know branches and he's like we all just have to unite because we're all serving the same flag That's the kind of mindset my husband Has I don't like speaking past I like speaking present because he's still he's still here till this day Everybody knew him out in Georgia Athens, Georgia. He was a wrestler good boy. He Loved his fishing loved his guitar. My gosh, the man can play strings. Let me tell you Very talented in many ways When he said himself to do something it got done whether It was building a crib. He never followed extractions. He was like, I don't need the pamphlet. It's all here He was that smart sometimes It was hard for him to screw like I remember I have pictures of him fixing livias crib and And He threw the extractions away and he was like, ah This screw is not going in but I'm gonna make it work and it was a long screw And I was like you probably need this moment and he was like no And I was like, okay But he made it work. He made things work Not just for himself, but for everybody And boy was he a mama's boy Still makes her feel like a queen They always said the way that the man Treats his mom is the way that you know how he's gonna treat you And boy Did he treat his mom with so much love and so much respect and spoke so good about her He's like my mom's like the most southern hospitality woman that you would always meet and She's the love of my life and always had her on this pedestal and still does He was battling He said till death do us part And so till death do us part He was suffering and battling His demons like we like to say And he knew he was battling these demons And it was day to bid day VA visits and the list goes on He attempted once and I was pregnant at the time With Olivia and Normal day Making dinner for the kids And I found him he hung himself in the bathroom The only first thing the thing that just came to my mind was to cut the cut the wire and lay him down and start doing CPR I Didn't know anything about First aid or anything at the time I just saw it in the movies that I did what I did and I brought him back He was on my support For a day and a half and then just praying and praying and praying My higher power was like he's alive when he woke up. He didn't know who I was He didn't know who he was so it took time We stayed in the hospital for like a week and July 4th was when he picked me up and he said Maria you're my wife. I have two sons and I have two stepdaughters and I'm a mama's boy And Then God granted me three more months with my beloved husband I didn't see signs I Was oblivious to what drugs were Because I never really I only smoked pot And drink I was not even a drinker at that time when I was with Michael at all I Was Maria Maria Simon to that when he was a live and On August Every August I always fly a balloon for him To honor him I Know that he's looking and I know that he's been with me through this whole journey of my recovery and Through the process of all, you know what an honor to have him as my husband October 7th was The most awful day of my whole entire life I remember He got me up from the couch and he was like I used to wear this gown this pink gown silky and I was big old pregnant Olivia was huge and he would be like oh, I hate that gown And he went to his closet and he grabbed one of his favorite shirts And he's like this is my favorite shirt and when he was he like grabbed my gown and he took it off And he put me on his favorite shirt And he's like this is my favorite shirt He's like and I want you to wear it He was like I'm gonna go outside and I'm gonna smoke a cigarette But prior to that we had sleepless nights Due to the fact that I was always worried about him leaving the house or if he was gonna do something I was already traumatized. I didn't I didn't see it as trauma at the time and On that day on the 6th, I was Falling asleep. I was pregnant and he used to always tell me we're not wife We're not windshield wipers. We're staying up and that day on the 6th. He miraculously just let me sleep He put the dog inside the room and he was just like I'll be back I'm gonna go smoke a cigarette and I'll be back in bed and I said, okay, and I fell asleep Then I woke up. I think like it was around like six Six o'clock around six thirty something And my heart just dropped I Felt something Something had had happened because Otto at the time our dog was scratching the door and I Was like, okay, let's go and so I'm with my big old belly with Olivia 27 weeks and I'm wobbling through and I'm like Michael he's sleeping on the couch. He wasn't there In my heart dropped So I went to the front and I went and go see if he was in the front sitting on the patio in the front and he was It there and then I see Otto Scratching the patio door. I'm like fuck He's probably on the phone with somebody right now He was Responsive Floor And the only thing that came up was calling 11 And I did And I kept doing CPR on him till APD got there paramedics got there And I was like, no you're not taking him from me because we have a doctor's appointment and he never missed a doctor's appointment at all never I'm like, no, he's asleep and then You know APD gets there Little the officers trying to call me down and obviously I'm like no no Her partner was trying to do CPR and the paramedics arrived And I'm just sitting there like he's coming back I I feel him I know he's coming back And the MT you could tell that that was his first call ever he didn't know how to tell me I Didn't know anything about Narcan either. I didn't know anything like at all at the time And so at the time the MT he said I'm sorry miss Simington, but Your son You're husband passed And I just remember yelling at the top of my lungs why We have a doctor's appointment our daughter no Janique No, no, no, and I quit crazy and I wake up in the hospital I still couldn't believe it I still had to see his body just to see him His parents flew out I don't wish there's a pot anybody but it just sucks to even talk about it till this day Mookie was loved by many people he was loved by his family His military family his community he impacted so many people I Could tell you that Mookie still lives To the investigation they did an autopsy on Michaels Orient I had them go like deep because I wanted to know like What happened? And I kept calling the Omni every single day that's how That's how bad I wanted to know What was happening what happened to my husband? They got back to me and they told me he passed a fentanyl poisoning I Didn't know what fentanyl was like I said I barely, you know Did drugs when I was with Mookie? and I started investigating it and I started going into detail like wanting detail specifics of What this drug was? They said it was counteractive in pills and cocaine and Numerous of other drugs that they started putting it in I Started seeing the prevention the preventives of it as well the Narcan and I always sat there like What if I Would I had Narcan at that time? I Didn't know anything What they got didn't know was that Michael always wanted to do good for wherever he was stationed at for the community So I started gearing myself up putting on my gear and thinking what do I need to do? because this is sickening and So I started making my way in and to the industry Actively I started consuming alcohol and drugs at the age of 27 after Going on 28 I could say 28 because I moved out to Georgia With the Bill and Tony and they helped me with the girls I The support system out there magnificent till this day I Still receive a big support from them I Lost myself in the process of losing my husband and alongside my sister Caroline was with me throughout the journey But she always kept tabs on me ever since we were little girls And she was she was like gosh, I don't know how you do it But you're you're about to explode You're doing good things I Didn't really know where I was at I just know that I wanted to advocate and The stigma about it is hard And so for me I started going into thinking all right What would Mookie do I Got into promo modeling I did I dance for an IFL professional IFL dance team for the state of Mexico Duke City gladiators That was a door opener for me. I ran the purple flag in honor of Michael No, that's soon as I knew that I was Running that purple flag, I knew I was doing something right I knew I was getting ready to season myself up like they like to say and The time we were getting a lot of partnerships at the time and then I met miss Lisa Cedillo white the founder of keeping him alive Chuck Lopez was the one that Introduced us and he said this is where you need to be at Maria And he grabbed Lisa's hand at that time in my hand And he combined it together and he said this is Maria Simon 10 and this is Lisa You guys are gonna go out to the field and we're gonna flip toss the flip flip the coin And from there history was made History was made because Mama Lisa I called her she brought me into her organization and made me and molded me into the woman that I met right now The keeping of my life family has seen me go up and down and everywhere and Just like Anna I Know is loved in the community as well They called her Chola, but she was a good kind She would be people up because they would bully people that they weren't supposed to like me For instance, I was a bookworm Everybody would be like your sister's book smart your street smart on a should be like yeah, and your point is Doing my diligence by making sure people understand that they don't need to pick on people that are actually trying in their life to excel That was her motto and it went with her till the day she left this world I Was detoxing she I told her she needed to check herself in a rehab because she was wanting to stop drinking She just recently had her daughter Genesis And we both named her daughter just if I And I named my my second daughter her middle name out the Anna so it's Delilah out the Anna and Honor Vana, so that's how close me and on it were And on the 27th of March, we had a great conversation and she was coming home from the hospital because her Fiancé at the time he was detoxing himself so they had both, you know come to terms that They're gonna get sober for the sake of their daughter Luckily they were able to help him and During the process Anna wasn't really thinking about herself and I told her Go to CVS get you some electrolytes Take a good shower lay down And we'll talk more when you get to the house because she was driving She gets to the house she gives me a call And she was throwing up, but she's like my stomach's hurting. I'm like, okay. Have you eaten and she was like Yeah, a little bit of sandwich, but I'm feeling really bad I'm like, okay. Well, then you need to go get checked and she says no I need to clean the house So as she was watching dishes I was on the phone with her we were talking about our you know our life Where we were at and she was like, when are you gonna come back home Maria? I'm like, I don't think I'm ever gonna come home There's too much out there at the time I was in South Carolina And I told her there was too much out there for me that I I'm not ready to conquer. I'm not ready to To face The memories the past Well, sometimes you got to come home to find yourself again In the last words she told me she was like, I just want you to be happy and I want you to get your daughter's back And stay sober And I didn't I used Michael in honor as an excuse of my addictions Of all of my flaws everything that I went through I I Used them as an excuse And I shouldn't have never done that Because that's not the correct way to do an honor your loved ones that depart from this world As of right now I could tell you I'm doing better better than where I was before Spiritually mentally and physically I'm here. I'm grounded and I'm facing Facing reality and it feels so good to face it Because at the end of the day where I'm out in my life I Told myself I could do it There was the young little girl in me that was yelling at the top of her lungs make it stop And the only way that I'm gonna make it stop is by staying sober and by honoring them I'm advocating It's spreading awareness and letting people know that You can and you will if I can Come on you can too Nothing's impossible in this world unless you make it In the world that's around Right the world that we live in right now obviously we definitely needs a pool of a lot of TLC And from my experiences I From my experiences from my two internal angels They showed me that Where the year wherever you are Whatever you do You could be whoever you want to be but do it Do it with honor and integrity I feel liberated I feel great I feel like This is the the beginning of Maria Dolores I went in You",loaded_from_file,14853,"FENTANYL KILLS - Maria Simonton, Recovery After Loss - episode 228",1756.0,3,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00
9VfUnZ-uxTs,"Why am I here? So I spent 36 years of my life in addiction, 33-time convicted felon, 28 and a half years of my life in prison. The first thing I would say is that I used to be part of the problem, the drug problem. In 2017 God revealed himself to me. I surrendered my life to Christ. I went back to prison for two years, two and a half years. I came home from prison January 20th or January 2020 and three months later they found my sister dead in a hotel. Her and a guy was in her smoking fentanyl and she lost her life. He didn't. A few months later a couple more friends of mine overdosed. Fast forward, I just started to see this thing called fentanyl which really I just thought it was like heroin or whatever and I just didn't know. And the more I was around it, the more I seen it up close. I am a co-founder of a ministry called Living Proof Ministries today. And so we go after people who the community has given up on. We believe that to know a name and know a story is impactful. I think that when you know somebody's name you can probably love that person no matter where they are in the world or in life. I'm real big on stopping at stores, talking to people, sharing the grace of God with them because I understand addiction. Again, 36 and a half years of my life I started shooting dope when I was 13 years old. Fast forward, 2023, actually 22, I've spent the last four and a half years of my life dedicated to recovery ministry. I believe in getting with people. People from my past as an ex-drug dealer, a lot of my friends still deal drugs, they still get high. I never prayed that God would take my addiction away. I don't believe he does, but I prayed that God would give me the strength to face other people in addiction and not want to get high. And God's blessed me with the ability to not want to get high when I see it or I'm around it. 2022, I took a good friend of mine, son, to Omaha, Nebraska to a program. He went up there. At the time I found out he was struggling with fentanyl, opiates, pills. He went up there and done well. Was still trying to smoke weed, got a dirty, they put him out of the program. He came back to Springfield, went back up there. January, I want to say 18th or 19th, we went back to Omaha. I spent the weekend with him. We drove back to Springfield from Omaha. I got a call at three o'clock in the morning. His mom said the police just left my house. They found him dead in the bathroom up there, overdose. Around July, another good friend of mine died, fentanyl overdose. She'd laid in her apartment for three or four days before anybody found her. About this time last year, August 21st, 2023, my very best friend, his name's on there, Derek Williams, came up missing. We had had conversations. A girl that was in his life, she just started to, had him shoot fentanyl. Said it was the hardest thing you'd ever done. He had went into a program over here called Broken Branches and was trying to get it right. At the time, he had custody of his daughter. He was in a bad breakup. Really what happened was, exactly around this time, we started to print flyers. It was probably about August 27th or 28th. He came up missing on the 21st last year. It was a Wednesday. What we was going to do was we was going to start hanging flyers. That Saturday, we was going to call him in the neighborhood. His house was at a known drug house. His car was at a known drug house and he wasn't there. One thing I can tell you about a drug addict is he's not leaving his car anywhere on foot. I promise you he's not. On August 31st, I get a phone call. Stop hanging flyers. I said, why was up? They said they just found a body. Derek was a guy who spent his life shooting methamphetamines. They had gotten him high, taken him out here on the west end of town and kicked him out in some tall grass. A guy come to work that morning and smelt the body. That was August 31st. My cousin Roscoe Chote, which is really the... My fight against fentanyl has come about because of Rocky and Derek and my sister. A year ago, I put him out of my house knowing that he was getting high. I haven't used drugs myself since July 2017, but I needed him to be close to me so I could make sure he was okay and I put him out. A week later, I get off work and I get a call that he was dead. This is a problem. He was probably the closest person to me in this world. We're the same age. My mom and his dad are brother and sister. Everybody wanted me to thought that I would just go back to using drugs. I'm not a real big recovery guy. I'm really not a more of a God guy. I think that the world tells us that the world's got an answer for a sin issue. In the world, I've written programs. I've facilitated every program they've got. I've been through every 12-step whatever. I'm not a real big 12-step guy. I'm a God guy. I believe that why would we go to the resource when we can get straight to the source? It lit a fire under me, which is how I met some of the people that's come in here today. We just last year in October, we decided to do a fentanyl rally. I always say the devil's got a new F word. It's called fentanyl. It's killing people. A lot of times what we fail to realize is that it doesn't matter to you until it affects you personally. It's kind of like cancer. You don't think about it until it's your mom or your sister or your brother. Fentanyl is the same way. The reality of the fentanyl is that it doesn't have a color, an age group. I don't care where you stand in life, what you have, how much money you got. Money cannot fix this problem. The reason that I know that is because I watched it up close. What happens is you start to think and you give up on these people who honestly, it's like they won't stop. They're still in front of me. They won't quit getting high. I keep having to bring them back. But what I failed to realize is that they didn't have a choice. They don't. I mean, imagine just waking up every morning in absolute pain. Women walking away from their children. Men walking away from their families. This drug has no, it doesn't care. And so over the last year, what we've done with our ministry is we have a fentanyl awareness. We do rallies all the time. We go to different places and preach. In the last four and a half years, God's done amazing things in my life, but he's also given me the ability to be a voice. And so I have a lot of people that follow me in this city because they say if I can do it, anybody can do it. And so I always say, man, people don't always believe what they hear. They believe what they see. And so I continue this fight. And it's hard sometimes. And I want to give up. But when we think about the people that we love, if you was to lose them today, would you still want to turn your back on them? Because here's what happens is we give up on them. And when we give up on them, you've got two things. You've got abandonment and you've got addiction. And I don't know about you. But for me, that shows a recipe for disaster because guess what? Nobody cares. So it doesn't matter what happens to me at this point. If I died, nobody's going to care anyway. They don't have to worry about me. But then we're left to pick up the pieces. And so we have to be that voice. And so we've got to also be that person that says no matter what, I'm going to go out here in the streets and I'm going to go after this thing called addiction. And so it's not a choice. Once they become addicted to it, the only thing we can do is love them through it and hope that we can get them somewhere to get them off of it and get them some help because they're not recovering addicts. If you ever meet somebody that walks away from heroin and they're still breathing, they are survivors. They are not addicts. They are not recovering addicts. They're survivors. A couple of times a year, I'll go to a recovery program, a 12-step program. And it always amazes me because it hasn't changed from 30 years ago. And when I say that it hasn't changed, here's where I mean. It's idolatry at its best, right? You've got a group of men and women and you hear them do their testimony and they say, man, I just don't know where I'd be without this group of people. And so my question afterwards is always, well, what if everybody in this group dies? Where does that leave you? Does that mean you go get high? Because this group of people is gone? But see, we serve a God who says, I will never leave you. I will never forsake you. And he says, keep my commandments on your heart and live them out. Walk them, talk them, teach them, put them on the walls of your house. I have purposely looked in people's houses that are believers and you always find scripture on the wall. And to me, that's an amazing thing because that's what we're commanded to do. And so how do you know what God's commanded you to do if you don't pick up your Bible and read it? You have to pick it up. You have to read it. And so for this week, I've just been busting my own self down. Like, you know, I've got a good job. I work with good Christian men. I get to do this. I don't have to do this. I didn't have to come on here and say, hey, let's host this Dana and let's get this thing going. I don't have to do it. I get to do it. The church we're using, Pastor Assembly, we get to do it. We don't have to do it. But he says I'm on board with that. And so what we get to do is we get to come in here and we get to do what? We get to tell somebody's story and we get to, we get to, man, we get to serve God's grace and mercy because we know where the answer lies. It doesn't lie in the world. The world can't fix this. So what happens when you go to these worldly resources, these programs and all this and that and it disappears? What's that leave you with? Nothing. Nothing. But then there's God. But then there's God. And you know, and these people are overdosing. And the first thing we say, man, I hope they're believers. I hope, you know, and who knows? Like your salvation between you and God, I don't know. I can't speak on it. But I know a lot of people and they believe in God. But I know a whole bunch of Christians that are going to bust hell wide open. You know? And so at the end of the day, my pastor's been preaching a sermon on getting outside of the gate exactly what you're doing. You can sit at home and do this all day long. Jesus died outside the gate. Moses went outside the camp. We're called to go outside to make a difference. And that's exactly what's going on here today is we're going outside the camp and saying, hey, we've got a problem. Rocky didn't want to die. You'll never find a guy with a bigger heart in this world. I promise you, crushed a lot of people. He just never could connect it to. He could never put it down. Not because he couldn't or didn't want to. It was just because he couldn't. So we have a ministry called living proof ministries because we believe we are living proof. Me and my friend of mine, we've been friends for a lot of years. He too suffered a life of addiction and I was a gang member. I was a gang leader actually in this city. I was a blood. I spent the majority of my life in the streets and so did Brooks. He felt like we was called to ministry. Two years ago, they was trying to take his kids away from him. They was up for termination of his rights. And I continued to chase him like, come on, dude, let's go. Come on, man. Come on, come on. No lawyer in his area would take his case. They said, man, them kids are gone. He said, I don't need you. I got God. The Bible says he was in me as greater than he who was in the world. I don't care who you are. You got a boss too. And it's probably God. And so he kept on fighting. Right now today, he's a single father with three kids under the age of five, raising them on his own with a business. Two years ago, he looked like he was walking death around here. And so him and I got together and started a ministry. We go to different places, midtown recovery. We're getting ready to start a church over here at Broken Branches September. And so we were out here in the streets. We go in homeless camps. We feed them. We go around the city. We take people. We pick them up. We talk. We pick them up. We get them in a program. We help them get a job. And so we just continue to do this because honestly, I'm just saying, if we don't do it, who's going to? And even the church I go to, like my pastor, my pastor chased me down for 30 years with the gospel. When people was telling him, he's never going to change. And here we are today. And I'm seven years with no drugs. June 23rd, I become a minister. I got a picture of my certificate right in there on my phone. And even that church, I said, I don't know if I'll stay here. And he said, why not? I said, because they're not willing to do what I want to do. And he said, what's that? I said, go to the north side of Springfield and try to save lives. We can sit in church all day long and talk about church. Let's talk about church with somebody down here all the time. And I'm telling you like rapid fire, the people in our church have come up out of that church. They signed up. We did an outreach over here a couple of months ago. 100-some people showed up. We've got a congregation of probably 300, maybe. But for 100 people to show up, there's never been on the north side of Springfield. You know, we drag them out. We make them uncomfortable. I do my testimony with a cop who, for 38 years, has sent me to prison multiple times. Today, he's one of my very best friends. Today, he just followed me to Omaha, Nebraska for a mission trip two weeks ago. FBI agents, they're my best friends. These are guys that's been trying to lock me up all my life. And I always say, man, we ain't smart enough to think this up, man. This is something only God could do. So we just keep walking through these doors because we know God's using us to build a bridge not only from, because they know I still hang out with guys. I don't hang out with them, but I still frequent these guys who are selling drugs because I got a story I like to tell everybody, right? Are you familiar with the Titanic? How many deaths was it? I don't know. I can't tell you. I don't know. But I can tell you this. There was enough boats on there for everybody to get away. But what happened was what? They started getting half full and taking off and taking off. And just recently, my buddy was telling me there was one guy who went back and he was beating on doors and he was saying, Jesus saves, Jesus saves, Jesus saves. And he lost his life while somebody else left in his boat. But see, the thing about it is, then boats got half full and nobody looked back. What type of man would I be to not look back? Because who better to talk to these guys I've been in the streets with all my life than me?",loaded_from_file,14871,Addiction to Recovery - Paul's Mission,1010.0,22,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00
avwelLFOUKk,"I have found freedom for the first time in my life after over 20 years of struggling in alcoholism and substance abuse, specifically meth addiction, and I am in recovery and I'm proudly in recovery. It's taken me a long time, a lifetime, actually a lifetime of relapse, incarceration, trying over and over and over again to find this freedom and I found it. I have found it. My childhood in upbringing was actually fairly normal. I grew up in a house, my parents were divorced, but that's super normal, right? Most parents are divorced these days and I didn't get heavily involved into alcohol until about my freshman year of high school and that was when I first discovered that alcohol made me feel powerful. It took away some of the pain of some of the struggles that I had been experiencing. One of the key moments in my life where things shifted for me, it seems like we all have those key moments in our lives where something happens in our teenage years and this is mine. My mom sent me to go live with my dad. I was 16 years old. I lived with him for about eight months and I was a little wild. I was a little wild and it was too much for my dad and my stepmom and they sent me back to live with my mom and the way that my 16-year-old brain interpreted that moment was that I wasn't good enough and that I didn't deserve a better life, that I...that's the best way to say it, that I just wasn't good enough. I dropped out of school when I got back to Texas after I had come back home to Texas and started drinking very heavily. I was hiding alcohol in my closet and it was a very short time before I was doing cocaine on a regular basis. I did manage to enroll into college throughout that time period but that didn't last because I was way too focused on having fun and drinking. And then there's a moment where it was no longer fun. And I think for people who don't have addiction issues, that's when they stop. And I didn't have an off button. I didn't know that I didn't have an off button but I didn't have an off button and I got involved with meth at around 21 years old and very shortly started shooting meth right after that time and committing crimes to support my habit and was just living that hard and rough lifestyle. It wasn't until I was 24 years old that things started to look up for me. I, through the midst of my addiction, got pregnant, which was an absolute saving grace for me. I had a little baby girl and was able to get clean and sober and I stayed that way. I stayed that way for four years. I married her dad. We lived a life and it was the very first time really since I was a child that I was able to experience something that was stable. I relapsed, which is such a huge part of my story. And they always say that when you relapse, you go back to where you were very, very quickly and it's so true. I can speak to that because that's happened to me every single time. And within a short amount of time, I was, again, living that hard and rough lifestyle, started selling drugs in a way that I hadn't previously lost my job and really started to get seated into a criminal lifestyle, if you will. The lowest of the low for me on my journey was when I had been using drugs and selling them for several years. And in 2011, was federally indicted by the federal government for conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine. I will never forget what it felt like. They were chasing me on a street in Denver, Colorado called Sixth Avenue and I kind of make a joke and I say that they chased me down Sixth Avenue like I was OJ Simpson. But that legitimately was what it was like. They ripped me out of my car and had guns drawn on me and I'm on the ground and, you know, get the fuck on the ground, bitch. They treated me as always a dangerous criminal. I was indicted. I didn't fully know what that meant at the time. I just knew, obviously, that I was being arrested and it wasn't until I had been in county jail for, I don't know, a period of time where I finally understood what the words like federal indictment meant, that I was actually indeed going to be, you know, locked up for a significant amount of time, what that was going to be, who knew at that moment. It's those moments in life or in my life anyway where the rubber met the road. I didn't want to live that way anymore. I didn't want to live in that darkness and I knew in my soul that there had to be more. And I don't even think I knew at that time what that would even be. And I spent my time when I was initially locked up in county jail, really doing a deep dive into who I was, what my belief systems were, what I thought was even capable for myself, healing, mostly healing. And that, for me at that time, was a massively deep spiritual journey or at least the initial parts of my spiritual journey they began at that moment. And prison was super hard and challenging. However, the best experience of my life in hindsight, I can absolutely say that hands down now because I was taken out of the game and the life just long enough to where I could get some true sobriety. I could get, you know, my head cleared and understand, you know, what was important to me. At that point, I had abandoned my daughter. I had abandoned her for drugs, a relationship that I was in where I was highly codependent. And I didn't want to be that woman anymore. I didn't want to be that mother anymore. I just knew that I wanted to create a better life for her and for me. I was released from federal prison in 2013, so I did a little over about two and a half years in federal prison. And when I was released, it was really hard. I had spent two and a half years looking forward to this time when I'm going to be released. You know, it's, you know, what am I going to wear? And all of these things, it's this brand new beautiful beginning. And it wasn't beautiful. It was really, really, really hard. I couldn't find a job. People wouldn't employ me. I struggled to, well, to do anything. I literally had $100 to my name. And when you have a halfway house as your home address, it's hard. That was probably one of the darkest times of my life, was living in the halfway house in Denver, Colorado, trying to figure out what are my marketable skills. My teeth have now since been fixed, but they didn't look the way that they look right now. They looked like I had been doing math for 15 years. And my self-confidence was, how about, is less than zero. There was no self-confidence. I didn't believe in myself. What I knew for sure was, was I had several felonies, a long criminal history, I lived in a halfway house, and no one would hire me. That's what I knew. I understand why the recidivism rate is as high as it is, because of the barriers and the challenges that are associated for those who are coming out of incarceration. It is, it's a struggle, to say the least. I finally found a job and got heavily involved. I just felt my face shift when I said that, because it's so true. I can feel it in my soul. It's almost like I can go back to that moment, you know, a decade ago. And I got heavily involved with an organization nonprofit called Dress for Success Denver. And even to this day, I mean, you can visibly see me getting emotional because of how much they impacted and supported me when I had been released from incarceration. They provided me with clothing and, and a career coach who taught me how to speak about myself and try to market myself helped me with my resume. And through that process, I was able to get a job. And if I, it's almost like if I didn't smile big enough and people didn't see my teeth, right? But the outside looked the part, okay? The outside looked the part that I, then I was marketable, right? And I did. I got a job. And then start on my journey, right? Once I got a job, I was able to get in and prove myself because I am highly driven to put it lightly. I am the kind of person that when I am focused on my goals and the things that are important to me, I'm on fire. When I am making bad choices and drug addiction and struggling and struggling in darkness, we're going all the way, right? It's, it's, it's either one road or the other. It's kind of like no middle ground, right? And life got better. Life absolutely did get better. I didn't know this language then, but I know it now. And the language is emotionally sober. After eight and a half years of being clean and sober, but not emotionally sober, so not really working a program, you know, I was trudging through it and doing it on my own and quite frankly, using achievements to show the world my value. So just like when I was 16 years old, right? It's the same thing, right? It's that same battle for half of my life, even longer than that, right? Well, hope I'm going to live to be a Sprite 90. But it's that same challenge of trying to look for my value in other people. And I did that after my release from incarceration. I needed people to understand me and accept me, right? And so I ran marathons and I worked myself to death and I did these things that, that try, that I was trying to prove to the world and quite frankly myself that I had value. And in 2019, I relapsed, which in my world of being the sober girl who made it out of prison, that felt like the worst thing in the world that could have happened. You know, now the persona is shattered and, you know, and what are people going to think about the sober girl? These are all the things that are in my head, right? You know, relapsing. And I went to rehab in California. And at some point through that process, that 30-day process, it didn't matter anymore. It didn't matter what other people thought about me. When I went to rehab, I was training for the New York City Marathon. And when I relapsed, I had been training and I used math for exactly six days. Exactly six days. And my friends who helped me get into rehab had to push me in a wheelchair when we got to the airport from the, like, security to the gate because I couldn't walk. You know, I had taken, what I had done to my body within six days blows my frickin' mind. You know, when I say I don't have an off button, I don't have an off button. And this is life or death for me. And interestingly enough, just yesterday, a friend of mine reached out to me to let me know that someone very close to me had died over the weekend. And she just wasn't able to get her addiction. You know, and that stuff rings very clear and true to me because this many steps in this direction and that's me. Right now I'm this direction, right? And so here we are filming this. But it is life and death and I have to do things on a daily basis that take care of me. And it's a very clear program now that I work for myself that have been absolutely life changing for me. Once I went to rehab and stopped living in my ego of what are people going to think about me, I need to show the world that I'm valuable and that I have worth beyond having felonies and struggling with meth addiction and being incarcerated. And all these things, these badges that I wore on myself, right? It's like in that moment I shed all of that. And I got out of rehab or started to shed it, right? It doesn't happen like this. It's a process, right? But at least that relapse provided an opportunity for me to get honest with myself, be desperate enough for change. But most importantly, drop the ego that my brain was telling me that it mattered what people thought about me and that I had to show the world, right? My value. I needed that. I needed that relapse and it was the best time of my life and also the hardest. You know, I'd been to rehab. I lost another job, right? Like, and God, what a beautiful experience that was. You know, I got to share with my daughter, hey, I relapsed and I'm sorry, but I'm coming back and then I came back, right? I started to work a 12-step program very heavily after I got home from rehab about three and a half years ago. And that process has given me so much freedom from the things that I have struggled with my entire life. On top of that, I became heavily obsessed with my ability to change my life through the way my thoughts work. Something magical happened inside of me when I understood that I am the creator of my world. I am the creator of my day today. I am the creator of my day tomorrow. I'm the creator of my day yesterday. It was like, and taking that control and knowing that now, it's like I literally am unstoppable. I spend my mornings intentionally calibrating and connecting with my trusted source. I meditate. I'm heavily, I use the word obsessed, but it's just so true. I'm obsessed with the way that my brain works and how I can put my brain and my heart into coherence and create vibrations and energy around me. And affect the collective consciousness, right? Share with other people, love. I've spent so long with everything being just about me. You know, as those of us who struggle in addiction were inherently selfish and it's not a fulfilling way to live. And the most freedom and happiness that I could ever experience or that I experience in my day to day is being able to just share my story and give joy to someone and let them know, hey, you know what, I've been there. You know, and I've been there in a big and dirty way. And I got out of it and right you can do. You know, these are the things that I, these are the steps that I took. When I lived in the halfway house, there wasn't a model for success. There was not a model for success. If I can show that model for success of, hey, I know it's hard right now, but if you keep going it on the other side of it is this, just something to hold on to. And you know, that story isn't just exclusive for those of us who struggle with substance abuse or alcoholism, right? I mean, that's universal. We all need to see someone who's made it out of whatever we've made it out of, cancer, eating disorders, right? That we struggle with, right? It's just so ingratiating and loving when we can share our stories with one another and pull some of those details. I need that, right? I need that and I utilize that in my day now. I look at my models for success, people who I really, really look up to and I'm like, okay, I want to be like this. I want to be like that and I implement those things into my day to day now because today I have goals. Today I am a woman who knows that anything is possible for me and I live without limits and those limits were only there put into my own head by myself. It's all bullshit. It's all bullshit and it's not true. And once I've shattered those thoughts and those thought processes, that's the freedom that I talked about at the beginning of this video when we started talking today, right? I have a freedom today that I've never had. My daughter is now 19 years old and I'm not going to go into the details of some of our struggles, but as you can imagine, she's had a pretty tough go of it. Much tougher than I ever had and so much of that is because of my choices. And she is now 19 years old and she moved in with me about seven months ago. I can't change the past, but we are rewriting our future and it's the most beautiful experience of my life. The legacy that I am able to leave behind is one of a woman who really messed up in a big way, but never gave up. And now I'm affecting my life and her life and our family's life as a whole and we cook dinner together and she tells me, Mom, I look up to you. She deserves the very best. She's the reason the way of why I work as hard as I do. Again, I can't change the past, but we are rewriting the future and it's the most amazing experience. I can safely say one of my greatest accomplishments as a woman and a human being at this point is that I am a good mother and that's a big deal to me because for so long I wasn't. It's important to me to be as authentic as possible with my story and be as vulnerable as possible because I want for people to understand truly where I came from. It's easy to show up in my life now and I hesitate to use the word pretend, but with certain people in certain situations, I absolutely want for people to really understand from the real place of where I've come from because it's a big deal. You know, it's a big deal if I would have stayed on the trajectory that I was on, I would be dead or I would be incarcerated or let's just say I would have made it through both of those things at this point. I would be homeless or I would be committing crimes in some other way, right? Like, that would be my life. I'd probably be dead, but instead I get to live with my daughter in this beautiful home and we get to share these amazing moments and I have friends today and friend groups that I've only dreamed of. You know, I am so obsessed with self-development and I get to participate in all these conferences and organizations with these amazing women, women who I never knew existed. There was a time in my life when I thought that these women wouldn't be my friend. That is not me today. Of course they want to be my friend. I say that in a funny way, but it's true, right? Like, I am a good friend to people today. I get to live this amazing, amazing life that I couldn't dream. I absolutely love what I do for a living. I love the people that I work with. I love the company that I work for. I wake up and it's like my dream life and every single day it just keeps getting better and better and better. It's never been like that for me and I would tell you that the takeaway here is once I took accountability for everything in my life, the good and the bad, all of it, every inch of it. Once I took accountability for everything that was happening and understood that I could shift it and shift it in a big way, oh baby, like that's the good stuff. That's the good stuff. That's where the freedom is found and it all, all of it in many, many ways points back to, not in many ways, in all the ways points back to alignment.

bXWDHI1vro8,"Fenton Hall, not the way to go. It's destroying our city here. Fenton Hall is coming in to Albuquerque and from one end of the town to the next and the other end back, it's a mess. There's people high on that stuff, 24-7. And I was part of the problem. I was definitely part of the problem. I started using cocaine when I was a young man in my 20s. That's when Pablo Escobar was bringing it in, cocaine was cocaine. But what it did was it took me on a ride that 28 years later, I had been through two marriages, 11 years in the penitentiary. My son was three when I went in and 14 when I came out, so I missed all them years with them. Drugs have always been instrumental in me. I guess what you would say is being normal. I felt normal. I felt this is the way I had to be, was to be high all the time. I didn't like dealing with issues that happened to me when I was a child. It was bad. It was bad. My family member had molested me. And so I struggled with that for so many years. And they used the cocaine to be able to suppress it and get by and deal with it. And so now I'm here to share my story with you. If I can help you, I can help somebody out there. Just one person through this journey, I'm good. Because that's one less person that's going to die from the fentanyl overdoses. It begins when I woke up that morning in a cockroach-infested apartment. My son had overdosed 11 times. And that was the fourth time that he had overdosed. And he was, I was with him. And I brought him back to life with Narcan. And so I got fed up. I said, this is it. I can't bury that poor kid. I went through all this to get to this point where I got him back in my life. And here I am wasting it on getting high with him, supplying drugs to him, supplying drugs to me. That's where it starts. And it hasn't been easy. It has not been easy. The last four years have been very trying. Never slipped up once. The only reason I've been able to stay sober is because of my faith in God. My higher power is God. And that's who I turn to daily, every single day, every morning. And excuse me. When we, two days later, after I got started on the wagon, as they say, my son, he jumped on board. And every day we read the Bible. We had some daily devotionals that we read. And both of us together fine tuning each other, talking to each other, how we're feeling, the cravings, so and so came to the door to sell us some. I ran them off and we'd go over stuff like that. Because it was important for us to stay clear of the people that were in the streets. They were actually our enemies at that point, because we were part of them. And so when they saw that we weren't bringing any money into the circle, well, then hey, you're a chump, you know what I mean? Hey, what's up? Are you for real? Because if you were real, be for real, if not, then let's get high. But no, we were for real. We turned down, I mean, we found it on the ground. We turned down numerous times where we could have gotten high for free. But no, it was more important for us to build a relationship with God. And that relationship that we built is basically what's keeping me going with my health issues now. I'm trusting in him, and it's all because of my addiction. The uppers affected my heart. Cocaine and methamphetamines, just because the uptakes, you're way up there and then boom, you're back down. So your heart suffers, it's a muscle, and so I'm having to deal with that now. Through medication and other things, but we can't seem to get a hold of it to where I can, how do you say, live a normal life somewhat? We shed a lot of tears, we hugged each other and cried a lot. We sure did, because of what we had done. We felt ashamed at what we had done because our families weren't weren't born, and they weren't brought up like that. His wasn't, my mind wasn't. With drugs and stuff. So that was hard, the guilt of stealing money, the crime and stuff that we were involved with, that was another thing that we had to deal with. My boy, he means everything to me. And because of those first month, I would say month, we had to maneuver out of that place. So I'm a veteran, and I served in the Air Force. And I utilized their HUD VASH program. And my son and I were both able to get on the contract and get a voucher to move out of there into another place. Now, if I could tell you how, we stayed in an apartment where we slept on a love seat. Me on one side, him on the other. We'd spray the floor with road spray. The ceiling, they'd fall down on us, so we'd have to keep up watching that. We had to get through that part. When we left there, we left with nothing. We left our TV. We left everything there that we owned. And so we moved into the new place, and that was actually our fresh start. Not looking around and seeing roaches crawling everywhere. It drove me crazy. We set up goals short term and long term. The short term goals were to seek out employment for him. Get him stabilized in that area as far as going to work every day. Because for so many years there, like seven years, he didn't work. We partied, that was it. So he had to, I had to groom him and get him pointed in the right direction. And I give all the rest credit to him because he pulled things together. Billy, you speak on the phone, which is his job to deal with customer service. And he did a wonderful job, dressing. We weren't thugged out anymore. We had some type of, people didn't look down on us. Because everywhere we went, they looked down on us. Here they come. Walmart was sending out a store walker. Here they come. All through my life, I had been in and out of programs. I did the A thing, which I'm not knocking at all. 12 step program, great. I've been to Stout Street, Delancey Street, Pier 1, Senate Corp, long term programs. Normally I would work my way to the top, to be the top dog in the house, to run the house. I was always a leader. I didn't follow too much. Always masterminded things in my head when we were getting high. I'm the one that would sit there and say, okay, Lish, today we're going to do this. And it would work out. Well, and same as was in the programs, which were some of them were church based also. I was sent out to other states to prospect other people for the men's home there for victory outreach. This time, it was just me and God. Me and God, that's it. No outside influence. Now, I will say this, we did go to Sagebush Church. That's where our faith started. We started going there on Sundays and we'd watch it also online. Now, Pastor Todd, he's a very charismatic, energetic individual. He has ways of putting words together that makes sense for an addict. Now, because not everybody could just say, hey, this is how you're going to do it with reading the word and getting involved in programs and stuff within the church, ministries. But we basically, we did a cold turkey, completely stopped. No, I mean, we didn't. I tell you, I never, he told me, my son, he says, you know, dad, I don't believe you. A couple days, we'll be high again. He said it before and then he saw. I didn't do it for two days. He said, well, let me try it. Kept going and going to this day. We do outreach with the ministry right now here in here in Albuquerque. Every three months we meet and that gives us three months of collecting items for him. Gloves, socks, food, any kind of clothing, prayer, just love on him. That's my thing. With the goddess of how bad they smell from urine and feces and the drugs coming out of their pores. And just hug on them and love them. Because most people didn't get the love that they were looking for when they were younger. A lot of, I've noticed that in a lot of addicts, including myself. My dad was an alcoholic. Excellent jobs up in, with the department of defense. But we didn't get that loving, you know what I mean? That type of just embracing. That's important. And every day we tell each other we love each other. My son, we hug it. He said, Brussels, there's in Spanish, arms, hug. And we hug each other. We show each other love and respect now. One last thing. Anybody that comes in counter with the testimony I've given you. There's nuggets that I put out there for you. Nuggets are gold. Grab hold of them and run with them. Be successful in life. There's no reason for you to stick a needle in your arm. None whatsoever. That knowledge is wiping the country out. There's a reason for it. Because of the cartel and whatever else. I'm not going to go into depth, but I know things. I've seen things and I've witnessed things. That the destruction that is laid behind it. Now we're making building blocks, okay, with people. We're trying to get them to lock arms with us. Come on with us, let's do this. And that's where we're at now.

cSEjTH120Zw,"I'm here to tell my story about addiction, recovery, and loss. I have been sober since 2011. I myself had an addiction for over 10 years of crack cocaine. I didn't get sober from rehab or anything like that. I battled off and on for years, sobriety, use, sobriety, use. Before I know it, a lot of time passed in there. I was in a few domestic violence situations that didn't help any thinking people are good to begin with and learn later that they're not as good as they said they were. But ultimately, in the end, addiction took most of my immediate family away. I lost my youngest son, James. He's forever 26, to fentanyl, meth, and morphine toxicity in March of 2021. After that, I had a 22-year-old daughter, Lexis Marie. She reached out, wanted to go to rehab, told me about meth, benzo, and alcohol addiction she was dealing with, and let me know that she was going to be going to treatment. The day after she got out of treatment, she ultimately died in a car accident. Two weeks later, December 1st of 2021, my brother, Randy, was 43, just turned 43 a few days before. He was an alcoholic. We knew he was battling with that, but he ultimately died of alcohol and fentanyl toxicity. As for to 2023, my oldest son, Thomas, had gotten started at a young age with opioid addiction. He had severe back pain. They took away the opioid pills, and after that, a so-called friend of his enticed him eventually into using heroin. His heroin addiction spiraled a little out of control, but he was still maintaining a job. He was a professional painter. After a few years, I guess they started putting fentanyl in it, and he got addicted to fentanyl without knowing it, and ultimately died after he relapsed, after a few months of being sober. August 6th of 2023, he's forever 32. Ever since then, I've been reaching out throughout the county, trying to figure out whatever I can do to help save lives, because fentanyl doesn't just affect the individuals. It affects the whole family, the siblings, the nieces, the nephews, the moms. The dads, grandparents. The children left behind. I started for every angel's abrovar, because I knew that I wasn't the only one around here that had been affected by this poison. I found quite a few, and I find more every day locally and throughout the United States that have been affected, not just 20-year-olds, not 30-year-olds, one-month-olds, 18-month-olds, five-year-olds, 10-year-olds, 14-year-olds. What is it going to take? We've already lost more people to fentanyl poisoning than we have in the last three wars that we've had. This is a silent war against our country, is what people fail to realize, and people fail to realize that it's important to have Narcan in your house or Naloxone is a lifesaver, like a fire extinguisher you have in your house. You don't want to have a fire in your house, but you want to be able to put one out if it happens. Elderly people are subject to taking too much of their opioid medication, and they forgot, and they might have took too much. People have pain medication that's hooked into them, and those things break sometimes. The pumps, they have opioid pumps that they actually have put in people in the last 20 years, that break, and people can overdose from that. Children are getting candy bags at daycareers or what have you. It's been in water bottles at concerts. It's scary. It's really horrifying, and I don't want my grandchildren being affected. I don't want to lose my one living daughter that I have left. I don't want to see any other families go through the pain that my whole entire family is going through now. Naloxone saves lives. There are other brand names, and then there's the Walgreens brand. There's other brands, but there's free Naloxone available at most of your health departments, local health departments, and any state that you might be in. I need people to know that. You may only be able to go and get a box or two, but that is enough for a family household. If you are not able to get Naloxone, reach out to me, because I will help you. That is my mission, is to make sure that everybody in our country has at least one or two boxes of Naloxone in their house in case of an emergency, just like you have your first aid kit, just like your insurance is lower if you have a fire extinguisher. You don't want your house to burn down. You don't want to lose a loved one. So what do you do? If you don't want your house to burn down, you have a fire extinguisher. If you don't want to lose a loved one, then you have Naloxone. It's the same story. We're not out there trying to hand out drugs to people, so please stop acting like we're insulting you when we're trying to offer free Naloxone to people and educate yourself. There's so many different groups on Facebook that have tons of education about fentanyl poisoning. Xylazine, all the zines. There's so many other drugs out there that people need to be aware of, because I do not want anyone to feel the pain that not just me, but my whole family feels after losing five loved ones. I've only talked about four. I have one more to add. In 2017, I was at work at Ford Motor Company and scrolling on Facebook on my break, I found out that my baby cousin out of 19 grandkids, Mark Hyatt, was found three or four days after he'd been laying outside in the woods by a hotel where a maid found him. I'm sure she's traumatized by it, but she'd seen him for a couple days and thought he was a homeless person maybe sleeping over there on the edge of the woods. Well, my cousin died from fentanyl poisoning in 2017. He was born in June, back in the 80s, late 80s, and he was poisoned ultimately in April 2017. He's forever 29. His sister and brother miss him so much. Brandon and Jessica, my cousins, I talk to them, check on them regularly. His mom, my aunt, Tammy, missed him terribly, but she just recently passed away also. And then he also left behind three children, Lil Mark, Sarah, and Dylan. And I check on my cousins too, my baby cousins, because they're growing up without their dad and since I've been so affected by this, I figure I need to reach out to them and make sure that they're being told what's going on out there because they're teenagers and they're early adulthood. So I don't want the same thing happening to them that happened to their dad because they might end up with a little depression or what have you. So we have good talks. And so I lost four loved ones to fentanyl poisoning. And my baby girl, after she got sober in a car wreck, three in 21, one in 2017, one in 2023. That's given me purpose behind all of the tragedy that my family has gone through. And I hope that I have reached someone with my story. If you're thinking about using today, think about living. Think about how life would be if you weren't using. Think about your children if you have any or your brother or sister or your mom and dad or just your friends. And if you don't have any of those, reach out to me. I'll do whatever I can to help you find a rehab or just talk to you in that moment. If you don't want to talk face to face, we can text. I'm very serious about this. And I know people can recover from fentanyl because I know people that have. I have a friend named Therese that has been clean for a few years now. A friend named Amy that has been clean for a few years now. And I need them to know how proud I am of them and how thankful I am that they're still here with me today because life would be the same without you. And people that are using today don't feel like just because you used today that you can't quit tomorrow because you can. And if you have one little mess up, don't hate yourself for it. Just reach out for more help. There's help available. You could call 2-1-1 wherever you live and find out resources. I don't know what else I can say that can change your mind today. But I pray that my story reaches at least one person, if not more. And help save a life. And if you're not a user, at least provide, you know, go out and get a thing of naloxone or Narcan and put it in your car in case you are driving by and you can save a life. All it is is a nasal spray. It goes up the nose. You call 9-1-1. They'll tell you the rest. The instructions are usually on the box. There's Narcan training videos available on YouTube and I save Florida. So be blessed. Have a good day. And thank you for listening to my story.",loaded_from_file,8411,FENTANYL KILLS - Losing Five - episode 287,953.0,55,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00
cTgUyxT7M9s,"I'm here because I care very much about people that have went through the recovery process, people who have experienced loss due to substance use or abuse, and our future in regards to children that are coming up and being exposed to substances as part of growing up in a part of life. So I work at a prevention agency and being here not only supports the community and the message that is so important to the agency I work for and myself, but it speaks to how big of an issue this is and how many families are being impacted by fentanyl and overdose and substances in so many different ways. I think it's much bigger than we realize, but then I sometimes encounter people that have no idea. And then I am first a bit shocked and then a bit scared thinking how can we get this message out? How can we get more people to have an awareness and an understanding that this is a really very serious crisis and could be far more impactful than we've even seen so far. We lost over 106,000 people in 2023 across the United States. That is down a slight bit from 2022. I think a lot of those numbers are still a bit preliminary. It's hard to get final numbers with all of the work that goes into that. I think that we have areas in Kansas, particularly, that are more impacted. Our county, is Shawnee County, where the capital city is located. We're one of the top counties in Kansas that's impacted by overdoses. We have other counties that have big populations such as Sedgwick County with Wichita and Johnson County with Kansas City that are more significantly impacted than us. They're also larger, but it's alarming how predominant it is in Kansas. We have seen a decrease from 2022 to 2023 of about 4% in overdose fatalities, but we need those numbers to be significantly lower. Fewer families impacted. I think the cost of a human life is too much to measure. A lot of what we focus on in our organization is education of youth. We are in a lot of schools in our community thanks to funding from so many grants. We're able to go out and talk to kids about different substances and the impacts that they can have on their lives from their minds, their bodies, their ability to do athletics and the things that they love to do. We talk about the impacts on relationships and how substances can really impact people there. We also work on educating families and the community through different events where we go out and we talk about whether we have speakers come in or we go out and talk about the impacts of substances on people, whether it be fentanyl or stimulants. We talk about how to recognize signs of overdose, how to respond appropriately, how to administer naloxone. Really being a resource in our community in terms of helping people to understand what to do that this is not something that's isolated to certain families. It can impact anyone from a baby to a senior citizen. This doesn't choose. So education is the largest portion of what we do in our agency. We also do evaluations or assessments to really try to intervene early. A lot of those are with youth that are referred to us from schools that have been caught within a substance of some kind or under the influence of a substance of some kind. We are a stop that helps determine if they need more assistance, whether that be mental health support, whether that be support with substance use, really education for the family and the young person. That's a lot of what we do. I think people get wrong that they think that it could not happen in their family. That's not going to happen in our family. I think people think that individuals with a substance use disorder choose to have that life. They choose to use substances. They choose to live that way. What they really need to know is that we're dealing with individuals that are dealing with trauma, with crisis, with mental health disorders, with real human problems that all of us face. And maybe they don't have the skills at that moment or maybe they don't have the supports at that moment to be able to move forward. But substance use is something that can impact all of us. Overdose can impact all of us. And we just need to really have that awareness that none of us are immune to this occurring in our lives. We do not have enough resources. I really believe that we have got to have more resources. We need to have resources for people that are underinsured or not insured. We need to have access available when people are ready. Because I can't force someone to be ready. You can't force someone to be ready. They have to decide when they're ready. And when they're ready, we need to have a place available for them. And we need to be able to support them and walk with them and help them to get to the other side of this challenge that they're facing. And it may take multiple times, but they need the love and the support. Sometimes that's tough love to get through it, because it is something that you can recover from. Recovery is possible. I know people that have been in recovery for years. And I know people that are very new to recovery. And there's really nothing quite like carrying their stories and knowing the challenges that they've overcome and how their lives have changed so much. And the work that they're doing on the other side is so phenomenal. I'm so proud of my friends that are in recovery. I do see a lot of people that are have found great support in AA or NA. I also feel like there's people that have found their way through other programs, Smart Recovery. I think it impacts everybody different. Everybody needs to find the way that's going to be most successful for them. I feel like that network of support is pivotal. And AA does a great job of really wrapping themselves together as a community and supporting one another. And I think that is really pivotal for people that are in recovery is being able to relate to others that have had this similar experience, have walked through some of the same challenges, dealt with some of the same hurts. And knowing that you can call upon those people at any time has to be tremendous. So I think really whatever way people can find the greatest support forward is going to be huge. I think you reach out, you find a trusted person, you find whether that be someone in your family, whether that be a community resource, whether that be someone that's a trusted friend to walk with you, to help get you there, to drive you to the center, to be your cheerleader and support in the car, to hold your hand, to get you to whatever that place may be. And don't be afraid to reach out. I think that stigma keeps that from happening a lot of times. People are afraid, are nervous about how people might respond to reaching out to wanting to get help. And we've got to just really break that down and really work on supporting people, to getting to where they need to go, calling those numbers, getting in the car, going to the ER, going to the crisis center, going, you know, if there is a place, if you don't know where to go, just reach out to a friend, reach out to someone that can help get you there.",loaded_from_file,7109,Finding the Path,625.0,13,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00
Ed2gb2yoG80,"I was like, oh, this is going to help me lose weight. I'll be able to stay up, hang out with my mom whenever the other kids are asleep because there's so many. You don't really get one on one time. My mom found out and she's like, what the hell are you doing? What's wrong with you? Because I'm very honest with her. I always was. Anything I was going to do, I needed her to know just in case something happened. She'd know where I was, who I was with and what I did. Whether she wanted to hear it or not, she was going to hear it. Well, I come from a huge family. My family is very close, very tight-knit. My mom had eight kids. We grew up. My uncle Louie was a big part of my life. My uncle Bo. They were my dads. My grandpa was my dad. My grandpa did five different prison terms. He had 302 tattoos. Super cool guy. He changed his entire life around and told us all these cool stories. You're like, wow, he's super cool guy. He's traveled all the way across the United States. He'd hike him when it was safe. His end of the story would be like, you don't want to do that. I'm telling you so you don't do it. He didn't do drugs, but he had a hell of a life. His, my uncle, would come over all these really cool flashy cars. We worked at a car lot. So he was car salesman and other things. And a man of power. Both of my uncles were really cool guys. And then Uncle Bo was more the laid-back guy. Therefore, when you needed him, so was Uncle Louie. My mom kind of fell into that pattern and straightened her life out for her kids. I was hanging out with a whole different crowd. My cousin had introduced me to my cousin Renee. And I thought these people were friends. Renee was really cool. All her friends had really cool cars. She was somebody to look up to, fun party in my head as a teenager. That was somebody you wanted to be around. And so my grandma started noticing a difference. Shipped me off to live with my aunt and bonner. She was like, you don't know what the hell is going on, but you're going to go live with your aunt Kay. You're going to stay there for a while. I was like, all right. She's probably right. I probably do need to get my shit together and go. So I went and stayed with her. But I missed my mom. I missed my grandma. I missed my sisters and brothers being around them. And then I came home sobered up. 2005 probably. I'm not even sure because in my head my mom's been gone five years. I know it's been nine. My grandma's been gone three years and I know it's been 14. So my grandma passed away. And I thought I'm going to be okay. I'm going to be strong for her. I had to play in the funeral because she put me down as the beneficiary of everything. I had to delegate where everything went. She was the strongest woman you'd ever meet in your life. She held our families together. And then when she passed away, I was like, I don't know what I'm going to do. I was working 72 hours a week at Waffle House. I did that for probably 12 years. She babysat and she kept telling me, Amber, you got to cut back on those hours because you're missing a lot of important stuff with your kids. Her and our grandpa really and my mom really had a strong faith background regardless of whatever was going on. They made sure we grew up in church. So I wanted to keep that path with my kids. And when she passed away, all of that went out the window. And I was like, you know, I really don't care about anything. I lived with her most of my life just because over there you're the only kid. There's not seven, well, six at the time mothers that you got to fight for your mother's attention. It wasn't really like that because she made sure we all felt loved. But I was a spoiled brat. I'm not even going to lie. And I needed all of the attention all the time. So when she passed away, I lost all of that. I wasn't the most important thing to one certain person because my mom had to, we were all very important to her, but she had to split that, you know, with everyone. My grandma was supposed to split that with everyone, but I was the first grand kid. And so, haha. No, yeah. I was priority number one. When she passed, I kind of just lost it. And you know, I stayed working for a while. And then I wasn't making enough money to get into my own place because I had been living with her. Every time I moved, she was like, oh, you can't do that. You got to come back home, you know. So I was very codependent on her. And then so I thought, you know what, start selling a little bit of this and I won't touch it this time. It's going to be okay. It'll be fine. So I sold crack because I knew I never tried cracking. I didn't want to do crack because crack is dirty. The crack is gross, you know, in my head. You know, there's a whole, I guess, crack was just really gross to me. I didn't want to be a crack head. When you're addiction, you, in addiction, you think that like you really think that, okay, this is bottom shelf. You don't mess with that. You want to be up here. I started doing that, not doing it, selling it. And I was making enough money. I didn't like that crowd. It was weird. They were blowing my phone up every 20 minutes. Didn't like it. And so I was like, well, we'll just sell Coke. You know, those people won't bother you as much. And it's, yeah, and it's okay. I didn't like that crowd. You know, that's not me. I'm like, oh my God, because, you know, I had been out of the scene for a long time. Didn't ever want to do Coke. You know, I didn't want to touch it. So I didn't. My baby brother was like, you're going to go to jail and you got a kid. You got to straighten your ass out. You got to stop selling my head. He meant stop selling hard drugs. So I started selling weed. And I was still working, you know. So in my head, I'm doing the right thing. I'm justifying it because that's what you do. And I didn't know how to sell weed. So it wasn't good at it. And I'm all about that fast dollar, not, or fast nickel, not that slow dime, you know. I want, I want instant gratification. I want it now. And those definitely weren't my crowd. They were way too laid back for me. And I used to smoke pot. And so, you know, that's not something that you want to do. You don't want to sell something that you like to do. And so I stopped doing that. And a friend of mine was like, I called her to see if she knew where I could get any, we called it kaka or peanut butter. And I needed to sell that. And she's like, no, they don't even have that anymore. A good shit's gone. It was crank. I said, well, what about red and black? And she's like, it's very rare. She said, now they have ice. I said, well, that's stupid. And she said, yeah, I know. But that I said, what does it even look like? Shards of glass. And I'm like, can I make any money off of it? Yeah, you can. A lot. Yeah, a lot. And I'm like, OK. It's right up my alley. So I started selling meth, but ice. And I did make a lot. I made a lot of money. Did a lot of really stupid things making that money. And I started doing it because meth was my drug of choice. And I lost myself. I got caught up in the money. And scared money don't make money. So in my head, that means you take all of your investments, all your profit, and you invest and flip, invest and flip. And that's what I did. You know, I made sure that my kids had everything that they needed, my boys, but they didn't have me. I sent them to stay with my sister a lot. And then finally, I realized that my son was almost 10, my oldest son. I knew I didn't want to stay in this life forever. And when Billy was about to turn 10 years old, I was like, what are you doing? He's going to do what you're doing when he grows up. He's going to think it's cool, you're glorifying this lifestyle. What are you doing to them? You're lost. And I said, Billy, you're going to have to stay with your dad for a little bit. Because I knew I wanted to quit. But I'm on the verge of losing my apartment. I'm about to, you know, I'm running from the police. Every time they try to pull me over, I'm taken off. I can't do that with my kids. And that's not a safe lifestyle. I'm not around safe people. No one was ever allowed to come to my house. But it wasn't smart. And I knew it wasn't smart. And I knew that he's a mama's boy, and he would be 100% ready to do whatever his mother was doing. And so I called his dad. It was him and Nick. I didn't think Nick's dad would let me have him back. And so I called Billy. And I said, I need to know that if I said little Billy with you, you won't keep him from me. And you won't let anybody be mean to him. And I can see him. And I can have him back when I get my life back. No, I promise. I said, don't let him know what I'm doing. Because he doesn't know. He knows I have money. He thinks it's from my friends that owe me money, that I loaned them. I'd already stopped working at Waffle House. I don't know why he thought I had money for no reason. But he was nine, so I could do no wrong. Nick was four. Billy was about to turn 10. So Nick really didn't know what was going on. I thought, in my head, he didn't. And so he went with his dad. And then he came. His dad lied when he said he wouldn't keep him from me because he did it for the right reasons. I wasn't together. But I would track him down like a bloodhound. That's my baby. And his mom, I might be a f*** up. But on his mom, he needs to know that I love him. He'd say, well, if you love him, get your s*** together. And I'm like, well, I'm trying. Is this really hard? I wasn't trying. It wasn't. I'd tell myself I was trying. But you get caught up in that life. And you start to love the lifestyle, the adrenaline rush you get from running from a cop. You know? That's one day I had both the boys over at my uncle Bo's house. He was staying with his friend. And so we were staying there. Max and I, we met each other again. We knew each other since school, like kindergarten, first grade. And then we reconnected through drugs. And I was with his brother. And his brother sent me to go and get Max with brothers in jail. And I go get Max. And instantly, my grandma told me a long time ago, you see those boys, you don't ever, ever talk to them. Those are bad boys. I'm like, yeah, I don't. But really, I was like, can't wait till I, yeah, they're cool. Long rat tail, back in the 90s, 80s. And he was a really cool starter jacket. He was a cool guy. Out of my league. But we reconnected. And we instantly had chemistry. I didn't break that. And then he was there helping me with my boys. We both would talk. We don't want to do this. We don't want to do this. Well, we thought, we're going to straighten our lives out. We ended up being together. Brothers in jail. He's never going to get out. I wasn't worried about it. Didn't really like him. I just had a boyfriend in jail, so I didn't have to worry about having one out. That would just clog up the plans, the money plans that I had. And it was easier to have one away, out of sight, out of mind, and know that I had things to do. And then Max and I ended up together. And that was a hell of a journey, the first part. I mean, we had a hell of a ride. We were always, always together to the point of obsession, probably. And I'm sure the drugs had a real big part of that. And then you get to a point where you're like, what if it's just the drugs? What if I don't even like you? And what if you don't even like me? It could just be we're high. And we like what we're doing. We like the way we are. What if we don't even like each other so, but that's not the life I want? And I would still talk to him about God and things like that, because I have a very strong faith background. And I was raised in church. And so was he. He had to go to Catholic school and things like that. And so we had a connection there, too. And I'd tell him, you know, I, he'd say, well, why you always want to talk about God when you're high? And I'm like, because I talk about him when I'm not high, you know? And you take him to the gutter of the guts. He don't leave you. You know? And he used a lot of alcoholics and prostitutes and things like that. And so he loves us. You know? We just got to love ourself to realize that he does. Max would, him and his buddies would have church. You know, they'd sit there and talk about the Bible and look up verses and stuff like that. Well, then this one time we go and we stay at my uncle Bo's house. And by this time, I had a warrant for my arrest. It was for a traffic violation that I got. I was working at Waffle House. My mom's big thing whenever she was doing bad, you know, she had all these nice ass cars, really nice. But she worked at Waffle House. And she's like, I got to show these kids that you can do it without selling drugs. You can do it without doing that. And so she did. And she busted her butt at work. And she bought a nice, nice truck. You know, she always had nice vehicles. And when she did that, she souped it up, you know, rams, tinted windows. I really liked to be like the loud radios and rams, blacked out windows. You know, my sisters and brothers are still really into cars and things like that. They're good. They don't do bad things. But they're really into things like that still. And so I had this nice Capris. And it had blue paint job on it, a white top, and blacked out windows. And I had a whole stereo system. I popped my Momo off. That was my steering wheel. And take it, you know, everywhere I went, because you can't sell a car if you ain't got the steering wheel right. I had lost all of that, you know, once I started selling drugs and stuff. But I got a ticket for not stopping all the way to stop sign. And I got it when my grandma was alive. And I got it paid all the way down to $10. And then when she died, I didn't care. And I didn't go pay the $10. And so every time you get a ticket, you know, you miss court date. That fine doubles and doubles and doubles. And will it doubled enough to where I was going to get in trouble, you know? I had every intention on paying it. I just never did. And then it's the thought that counts, right? I thought about paying. And then we're over here at my uncle Bo's house. And my bondswoman was a friend of my grandma's. And she's like, I don't know what the hell you're doing with your life, but you better pump the brakes, little girl. I'm like, oh, I'm fine. I'm not doing anything with my life. And she's like, yeah, that's just it. And so she was looking for me. She knew where I was. She wasn't really looking for me. But finally, she was like, enough's enough. I feel kind of like I spit in her face, because she was practically family. And they surrounded the house, blocked off a few streets. I was in the bathroom. The kids were across the street playing, Billy and Nick. So I took that opportunity to go in the bathroom and smoked meth. And I hear people outside. And I'm like, Max, I hear police radios. And he's like, you're tripping. And I'm like, no, I'm not. I know what I hear. Well, they were out there. The boys came in, and they were like, mom, there's cops everywhere. What's going on? And I'm like, I don't know. It's OK. So I called my mom. I said, hey, mom, they're here for me. My mom was sick. I can't sir. I said, they're here for me. I don't know. Stupid traffic ticket. And the boys are here. And I'm not going out of this house until my kids are with you. So you have to get here. And she's like, I don't have a ride right now. I don't feel good, but I'm going to try to get there. So she called my sister Chrissy. And she came. And my sister Minka, she came. My mom came with my baby sister, Raquel. And my boys, she let me hug them. The bondswoman let me hug them. My sister was there. And she's like, take Max to jail, too. He's a piece of shit. And he's probably in the house. And I'm like, shut up, Chrissy. No, he's not. What is wrong with you? What are you doing? And she's like, I'm tired of this. I don't care. Whatever. And so they took me in cuffs. And they were like, why were you in the house so long? I said, because you're waiting on my mom for my kids. And so I hope you're not going to get me in trouble for that, too, because I'm a mom above everything. I might be a bad mom, but I'm still a mom. And so I took the kids and gave them a hug and told them I love them. Told them I'd be right back. I'll figure it out. I'll be home soon. You're going to go with mom. They called me mom, all my kids do. And they call our mom, mom, because there's so many of us calling her that. And I said, you're going to go with mom for a little bit. And I'll be home soon. Well, it was a whole 13 days as long as I ever went to jail. It was 13 days. It's a real long time, right? But I saw my sons running up to that car. And I thought, you know, I'm never going to touch anything again. This broke them. It hurt them. And so I got out. And I had all intentions of being good. I called my mom, because I went to my uncle's house, because she had moved in between. She was in the process of moving. And I couldn't remember where her new house was. And so I called her. And I was like, mom, I'm out. And she was trying to explain to me that she was two blocks away and how to get there. And I just didn't get it. I didn't understand. And she's like, I'm walking. I'm walking there. My mom had nephrostomy tubes to drain the urine off of her kidneys. She come running up and hugging me, telling me she loves me and don't ever do this shit again. I'm like, I won't promise. I said, you got to help me get Nick. Because in that 13 days, my mom was sick. It was a lot for me to put on her. I really went with his dad. Nick ended up with his dad. And Nick's dad was like, no, you're going to fuck up again. I'm not letting you have him. And I'm like, you can't do that to me, because I don't know if I can live without them. They're my whole reason. He said, you promise you're not doing this again. I said, yeah, I promise. Bring me my baby. I got a seam. I knew once I saw him. I wasn't giving him a mac, whether he wanted to try to take him or not. It wasn't happening. So I stayed clean for a little bit, but it's really hard to be sober when your partner isn't. And I knew that if I didn't straighten my shit out, he was never going to straighten his out. And I could see real fast that he was going to be here much longer if he didn't. And my mom started getting sicker and sicker. And me and Max were just infatuated with each other. Like, I couldn't breathe without him. He couldn't breathe without me. And it was like, one of us had to be the strong one here, because it's not going to be him. It's not. And so my mom calls me and she's like, Amber, you got to straighten your life out. I'm dying. And I said, no, you're not. You're stupid. You just say dumb shit. You can't say stuff like that to me, mom. And she's like, oh, it's a reality. And I need you to accept it. I don't know when it's going to happen, but it's going to happen. And I'm like, OK, I'll try. And I started selling dope again, because now I need money. My mom's going to die. Me and Max were just constantly in the streets doing dumb stuff. And I ended up, he ended up going to jail. I got real sick, like sick. Couldn't figure out what was wrong with me. My mom said, I think you're pregnant. I said, I think you're tripping. And she's like, no, something's going on with you, and you need to go get checked out. And I was like, I'll just take a pregnancy test so you can shut up. Like, I'm not. Stop saying that. I had an IUD, and I had it removed. And you're not supposed to be able to get pregnant right afterwards. And I had had it in for 10 years. I get it removed. And I go to the doctor. You know why he's in jail. And they're like, well, you're pregnant. You're only a week, maybe a week and a half pregnant. But yeah. And so I had just re-upped. I called up my uncle Louis. And I was high because I knew I wasn't pregnant. I called up my uncle Louis. And I said, you need to come and get all of this. Everything, if you ever see me touch anything again, you need to beat the shit out of me. Because I'm going to lose myself in this. And I need to be sober when Max gets out. Or we're not going to make it. I don't even know what these babies are going to make it. Because I was getting high. And he's like, it's only a weekend. You're doing the right thing. And I was like, I have to do this. And Max calls from home. And I'm like, hey, I'm done doing drugs. I don't think me and you are ever going to get our shit together if one of us don't stop. And he's like, yeah, you're probably right. I don't want to live that life anymore either. I said, OK, well, here we go. We're going to stop. I'm done. I called my uncle. I asked him to come get everything and get rivet, get it out of my face, and keep everybody away from me. I don't want anybody around me. And my uncle came and he had to mess with me a little bit. You sure? You sure? Sure. Because now you're in debt, booger. And I was like, yeah, I know. But I don't care. Burn every bridge so I can't go back across it. And he says, OK, burn it. And I was like, all right, I'm done. And whenever I told Max, I had my uncle come and get all my stuff. I don't ever want to touch it again. We have to be sober or we're not going to work. And he's like, OK. And he got out. And he relapsed a few times. And he had a wild ride. And I'm sober. And I'm, oh my god, I remember being huge and pregnant with the twins. And my mom would hide Max from me because she knew that I was crazy. And Monica, his sister, was like, I need my brother. She was a stripper. I need my brother to come guard, make sure nobody hurts me or anything. And I'm like, well, that's weird. No. And she's like, he's my brother. It's not weird. It's a little weird. And so I didn't want him to go because I was trying, fighting so hard to keep him sober. And my mom lived in the third floor of the apartments. I lived in the bottom floor. And when I tell you I was really pregnant with the twins, I was really pregnant. I mean, Max would have to carry my belly behind me. I broke a toilet. I was so pregnant. Like, it was bad. And he went upstairs. I'm going to go talk to your mom. And my mom said, he's getting ready to leave. Just stay down there. Let him go. So I grabbed a knife because he ain't leaving. He'll leave, but he ain't leaving the way he wants to. And I ran up three flights of stairs. In my head, I was running. I don't really know how that happened. I was huge. And my mom said, he jumped out of the fire escape. I was like, what? I hope he broke his leg. And she's like, well, he didn't because he kept going. So you know, that fight for his sobriety in his life, because I knew he's who I'm supposed to be with. And I feel that in my soul. And so it would be easy for me to have these babies and just go again. And I wanted them to have him as a dad. I wanted him to be there because I saw how much he loved his daughters and his other two kids. And even though he didn't get to see them, and he loved Nicholas and Billy like his own. We were messed up, but he really loved my kids. And I wanted my twins to be able to have that. Finally, we get to a point where he's sober. And we have the best life, it felt like. Everything was good. And I stayed sober. I haven't touched drugs again since I had my uncle pick them up. And it was a little longer for him to get there. But he got there. And now for the last 11 years for me, I think. I don't know because I think if you try to remember your sobriety date, I think that in my head, some people, it might work different. But in my head, I would be dwelling on it. And it might trigger me to do it again. He doesn't know his sobriety date because he isn't paying attention to things like that either. But we're sober. And the way we did that was I told him, I'm taking the kids. And I'm moving to Chilli Coffee away from all of this. Either go or you don't go. And I gave him two weeks to get all that out of his system. And he's like, I don't know. It scares me. It scares me to stop because I don't know who I am without this. And I'm like, well, I know who you are. I see it. And I want you to see it. And so I just got in the car. Wasn't very nice getting ready to leave. Flipped out on his mom. And I got in the car and loaded up the kids. And I said, I'm gone. This is your final chance. And he's like, fine. I'll leave it all. Good. Let's go. And we went out to Chilli Coffee. We started our lives over. He had a few struggles here and there. But we found a good church that we went to and got the kids back in church. And all of our kids ended up living with us. And we had Kaley. We had Becca, Billy, Nick, Mary, Frankie. And then ended up pregnant with Chevy. And life is great. And then we moved a little further out to Brookfield, Missouri. The kids loved it there. It's so rural. I really miss it. So does he and so do the kids. And it's kind of harder to find a church there that we felt wasn't judgy because he's covered in tattoos. And I have tattoos, but they're hidden. So you kind of feel judged some places you go. And so it was a little harder for us to do that. But I got really involved in community. Girl Scouts, the girls making sure that the boys had everything that they wanted to be involved in because I did mess up so much of their life. I wanted to fix it. They got real involved in sports and made a lot of friends. And it was the life that I saw and that I had when I was younger. And now we finally did it. We finally did that. And then we ended up out here in Topeka. Billy moved out here. He got a job at my oldest son. Kaylee and Becca would go back and forth between our house and their mom's house. And it was crazy. It was a wild one hell of a ride. I'll say that. But through all of it, God pulled us through it. He never left us because if he did, there's so many circumstances that neither one of us would be here. A lot of people in addiction lose their kids. And that breaks my heart because your kids are always on your mind whether you're high or not. And you just don't want to go around them like that. You can't love yourself enough to get out of it. Makes it a lot harder to be there for your kids. And then you feel like you don't even love your kids enough. Like you're a piece of shit. You can't even love your kids enough to straighten your life out. Like who are you? But then when you do, when you finally realize that you are enough, and you're perfect the way that God made you, and nothing at all can tear you away from that, and everybody makes mistakes. Everybody does. And it's just where you go from there. You can bounce up and down and back and forth. And none of that matters because the goal, if you keep your eye on the prize, you're going to get it in the end. You're going to get it. And that's where we're at now. We busted our butts to get here. But now we have our family, and we've done really good things for our community. And we raise our kids in church. No, Sunday school teacher. I'm a cussie one, apparently. But I work in the nursery at our church, kindergarten, or birth to kindergarten. And I get to teach them a Sunday school lesson every Sunday. And my kids go down, and they're very involved in church. And yeah, and so is Max. So, dun-dun-da. Kept my eye on the prize, and it was a hell of a ride. But here we are. And I've never talked about my addiction. I was weird. Never done that. Never talked to anybody about it, because I just keep it hidden, because people look at you weird. Was I looking at you weird? No. Yeah, it was.

f9tV6TCmv3w,"I'm here to tell my story. I wanted people to know about recovery, to know a little bit about what I've been through, you know, how there was a time when I felt that I had no hope. My life was completely unmanageable and I was able to turn that around, you know, with the help of others and become the person who I feel that I was really born to be. So I was born into a pretty troubled family. Both of my parents struggled with substance use as their parents did. My mom, alcohol and a lot of mental health issues as well, untreated. And my dad, throughout his life, multiple different things, but crack cocaine was the main thing that caused the most issues. My mom was really young whenever they got together and had me. And you know, they got married and they tried to make it work and tried the best that they could. But that fell apart quickly. Whenever I was about 18 months old, they split up. And my mom, you know, she left. And it was just me and my dad. And my dad's addiction actually got worse. And that was, you know, the crack cocaine that he was on at that time. I remember like waking up in the middle of the night. I actually remember this at that young of an age, waking up in the middle of the night and being home alone in the house or being left in the car outside, you know, for maybe hours at a time while he was inside a house, you know, doing drugs. Although I didn't know what he was doing at the time. And it's crazy because I was in like really bad neighborhoods, you know, neighborhoods that like I would kind of prefer not to even like drive down the road with my kid in the car. And he would just leave me in the car. And I remember like all I was scared of at that time was like that like a little arm was going to reach out from under the seat and grab my leg, you know, because I was just a kid, you know, I didn't really understand like real dangers. I would go to my mom's every other weekend whenever I was and I really enjoyed that time with her. Whenever I was in elementary school, my mom began opening up to me and telling me stories about her life and some like really traumatic things that happened to her. And I've actually, the reason I bring this up is because I have done some in my treatment. I did some work through ACA and the adult children of alcoholics. And it talked about how they, how parents can share, overshare with their children. And my mom did overshare with me. She told me some really traumatic things that happened to her in her childhood. And it kind of affected me. I, you know, like she shared her whole life story with me. I was the first person she ever shared it with. And she was always like, you're my angel, you're my hero. You know, I kind of became her counselor in a sense. And and that's that ends up being how I connected with people is I wanted to lose myself in their experiences. So I became a very codependent adolescent. And when those relationships that I was that I was building with people failed me, you know, failed to, you know, give me the escape that I was looking for, I ended up turning to drugs. So my whole childhood and up until the last semester or so of high school, I was like a straight A student. That was another escape. I could escape into my schoolwork. The only thing that was holding me back from accomplishing anything that I wanted to accomplish was the fact that I didn't know what I wanted to do. And I didn't know myself at all. All that I knew how to do was to do what other people told me I should do. I was completely out of touch with myself. I didn't know how I was feeling. I didn't know who I was. I didn't know where I wanted to go or why I was here. And so I got into the drugs and I had an escape from that. You know, I felt like for the first time I could feel something, you know, that was my feeling in a way. So I graduated high school with a really high GPA. I graduated with honors and I decided I was going to take a semester off. And about 10 years later, I realized that, you know, my life had fallen apart really. I didn't just take a semester off. I put everything behind me that, you know, I had worked for up until that point. This is how I started using drugs. Before I started using drugs, I, okay, I became friends with somebody in high school. They smoked a lot of weed, one of my best friends. And my dad was just smoking weed at this time. He had gotten a little sober. Now he's just smoking weed. And he had like a huge bag of like some homegrown weed under his bed. And I knew about it. And one of my friends was smoking weed. And so I remember going under his bed, getting that big bag of weed out, and I would just like pinch some out of it, like grab a handful, put it in a bag, and then I would get like $10 for giving it to my friends. And so I was like this high GPA, high school student, never got in trouble, really quiet. Just so happened to also be like selling weed to her friends. And I remember one day, he really wanted some weed, or his brother did, my friend's brother, really wanted some weed. And he didn't have any money. So he was like, hey, I have these pills, and they're really worth like $5, but I'll give you five of them. And if you just give me $10 worth of weed, I'll give you five of these, and you could sell them and make more money. Well, like I didn't know anybody to sell these pills to, and like I wasn't looking for them. So I just put them in a bag in my room, in a purse, you know, and hit them. And then, you know, and I didn't even really smoke weed yet. I just sometimes with my friends. And one day it was a really bad day. It was a really bad day. My stepmom had wrecked her car. There was she had just like recently, you know, attempted suicide. And there was just like a lot of stress going on in my life at that time. I took one of the pills out and I broke it in half because I was like, I don't want to take this whole thing, you know. And I broke it in half. I took the pill. I forgot that I took it after that. I didn't really know what to expect or what I was doing. And I think I maybe took a nap or something. I woke up and I remember talking to my stepmom while on the phone. And we didn't really connect well. But in that phone call, we connected so much and like we talked and we cried. And after the phone call, I realized, oh my God, I took that pill. That's why I was able to, we just had that heart to heart talk is because I took that pill and, you know, now I can feel my feelings and now I can, I can, I can communicate so much better. And I was convinced that it made me better. Yeah. So I, I, that was the beginning. You know, I would take a half of a pill, maybe every couple of days or whatever. But eventually I ran out. Eventually I started trying other pills too. Some that I liked, some that I felt made me better and some that freaked me out and that I didn't take. And so it was like that for a while. I, but I ended up, I ended up going to harder drugs after about five years of functional drug use. I went to harder drugs. There is a drastic change in, in, in what happened after I, it's like before hard drugs and then after hard drugs. You know, I could, I could believe the lie, you know, that I didn't have a problem during my functional drug use time. After that, after I went to hard drugs, the, there was no lying. There was no lying to anybody, no lying to myself. You know, with the other stuff, I could put it down for a few days at a time with the meth from the first time that I did it. The withdrawals, the, like the coming down was so horrible. I didn't, I couldn't handle that. So I would just do more because it was like the only way to feel okay. Like I was already addicted to other things, you know, and so I already have these addictive, like this addictive brain, this is addictive tendencies. And that was kind of game over for me with the meth. I lost my job. I actually had my own house and I, everything I lost. And you know, I was able to, until that time I was able to maintain a decent reputation in the community. You know, I had good images on Facebook and you know, nobody knew the things that I was struggling with, but within a few months of me doing the meth, I had a mug shot out on and I'd never, but prior to this, I had never been, I had maybe gotten like one speeding ticket, you know. And I had a mug shot out and it was, you know, it said meth on there, like meth amphetamines. My picture and it was on Facebook and it was going around. And that was horrible. I remember I found out I was asleep and I woke up to my phone buzzing, buzzing, buzzing, buzzing, buzzing. And I had like a hundred friend requests. I had messages from like everybody I knew and I clicked on the photo and it had just, had just basically just gone up and I clicked on like what they were talking about and it had tens of thousands of views. I was just like, oh my God, you know, it was a whole article because I'd gotten pulled over in a vehicle with somebody and there, you know, and there was meth, the driver threw meth out the window. And I mean, I was using and stuff, but we all got charged with that. And then I had like an Adderall pill in my purse. So anyways, I went from, you know, I could just stop, you know, and everything would be okay, you know, to okay, so now I'm looking at felony charges and, you know, and everybody knows that, you know, I'm just this person on meth with felony charges and, you know, so that was a big deal to me. I began to lose hope. You know, I remember in high school, like I wanted, I didn't know what I wanted to be, but I wanted to be something along the lines of like a doctor, lawyer, you know, and it's funny because I took a career test in high school that said I should be a counselor or a social worker. And I was like, nah, they don't make enough money. It's funny because now I'm going to school to be in LCDC. I have a 4.0 GPA again. I work for a nonprofit and recovery support services as a program coordinator at Avenue 360 and I love my job. I love the people who I work with. I actually read my textbooks and I enjoy reading them, you know, and so it's funny. I, during my treatment or now after my treatment, I took another career test and it told me that it told me the same thing again. And it just like, it flashed back to in high school reading, reading those same words. And I was like, oh my God, like it's still 10 years after everything I've been through. It's telling me the same thing. And I was like, okay, God, okay. I didn't say yes then, but I'll say yes now. Like I don't want to find out like what my life's got in front of me if I say no again. And I love it. You know, I feel like that's, this is where I'm supposed to be. Okay. So let me tell you about how I came to find sobriety. Okay. So I, I'll disclose I'm a lesbian, but during my drug addiction, I was on meth, you know, and other drugs and I was sleeping with men for money or pleasure or whatever. I was on drugs. So it didn't really need a reason to do anything. But during that time, I ended up getting pregnant. And I knew that, and I kind of wanted to because of the fact that I saw no reason to live. And as irresponsible and ridiculous as I know that that is now. And like a self perpetuating cycle because that's why my mom got pregnant with me. And I remember thinking in my life, I know how selfish, like that's so selfish. But you know, that's what happened. I was a total wreck. I was very suicidal. I, my life was, was a mess. I was, you know, waking up in a hotel room, trying to figure, you know, it's about to be check out time. I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to come up with some money, you know, to pay for a room for another night, or am I going to be, you know, throwing all my stuff in a backpack and, you know, walking down the street looking for somewhere to charge my phone so I can figure out how to come up with some money. So I have somewhere to be inside. You know, and there was a lot of other bad things too around that time. But I, so I was, you know, I was suicidal. I felt like there was no hope for me. And so, and I would just kind of like find people that I could like cling to. And I felt like if I could, you know, if I could save them or if I could help them, then it would give me a reason to keep going. But I couldn't help any of these people. Like I couldn't even help myself, you know. And so it was just like bad, bad, bad. Like one thing after another kept going wrong. And I got taken advantage of a lot because I mean, I was asking to be taken advantage of basically. And so I, I thought, you know, if I get pregnant, I can just, you know, give my life to this person and they'll be like worthy of it. And that's the most crazy and irresponsible thing again. That I was high. And that's kind of how that, how that went down. I, I was, I would take a pregnancy test and I took about three. The first one, and this is like within the course of several months. The first one was negative. The second one was negative. And I remember feeling kind of disappointed whenever I saw that. And then this, the one pregnancy test I took, I actually bought, I went to Walmart, bought a pregnancy test and went to the restroom and took the pregnancy test in the Walmart restroom. And I saw the second line come up. And I, my entire body like turned red and flushed. And I was like, what the hell have I done? I was like, what am I doing? You know, like what, what is wrong with me? Like, why did I do this? Why would I bring somebody into this world? Why would I bring somebody into my life even? Because I don't, I don't have control. But I thought, okay, well, I'll try now. I'm going to try. I'm going to stop using. I'm going to try. I'm going to, I'm going to figure something out. And so, you know, I told everybody, you know, look, I'm pregnant. And throughout my entire pregnancy, I actively tried to stop using meth. I tried. I wanted to. I cried after I'd used. I'd cry and be basically, if not literally, pulling my hair out before I used. And I couldn't stop. I, there was multiple times where I was able to stop for maybe up to a week max. Then I don't know. I would end up using again. And I hated myself every day. So, yeah, I was in a hotel room in Webster whenever, whenever the contractions got so bad that I had to go to the hospital. I had minimal prenatal care. I was taking the vitamins. And you know, but I had very minimal prenatal care. I remember one of my friends got a, got a rolling chair because we didn't have a wheelchair. I sat in a rolling chair. They rolled it to the elevator and then rolled me to the car. I said, take me to clear like regional hospital because I know it's a good hospital. This baby needs something good. And so I went there and I just told them the truth because I was like, whatever happens to me is whatever. You know, I told them, you know, I've been using this is what's going on. They checked me. I was nine centimeters dilated. I'd actually been in labor for probably days. It's crazy. I just thought if I just put my feet up, if I just keep my feet up and I stay sober, you know, maybe then I couldn't even get sober, but I don't know. I was crazy. So so I'm nine centimeters dilated. The girl who I think that I love is there with me. And at still at nine centimeters dilated, she says that she needs to go out to the, she needs to go meet somebody in the parking lot and that she'll be right back. I'm like, just wait, you know, just wait. And she was like, I'll be right back. I promise. And she left and she actually took my keys with her and left in the car for like several days, which I didn't know at the time that she had the car, but whatever. And so I was there alone whenever I had my baby. And I was really fortunate for that because at that time I got to really bond and connect with him. I remember looking at his eye, looking in his eyes and and seeing it was a spiritual experience. I saw him. I looked at him and I thought, you know, how I thought about how my mom, I thought about my mom at some point in time, looking at me in the hospital, just like I was looking at him. And I remember thinking that he's perfect and he's innocent and he's doomed, you know, to be just like me, just like I was doomed to be just like my mom in ways. And I wanted to protect him. I didn't really know how. But you know, in that moment, I decided that I was going to try and I was going to try my hardest. Shortly after this, you know, about two and a half days later, a social worker came into the room of the hospital. And I was given discharged papers and told that it was time for me to go and that I was not taking him with me. Rightfully so. That was the pain that I felt that day and that experience was also pivotal in my life because I needed that. I cried like I've never cried in my life. I've never felt that pain before and I felt a lot of pain. But that was like the only pain that I knew that drugs wouldn't take away. I knew that using drugs was going to prolong that pain. And you know, I was really able to make a decision. And so even though before I knew like that I wanted to stop using and I wasn't able to, that time I was able to. And I think I was really fortunate that I went to Clear Lake Regional Hospital and that I guess the week I ended up giving them my my dad and my grandma's address, which was in Fort Bend County. And so I got a CPS case in Fort Bend County and Fort Bend County, although it's a very strict CPS program for for the young children. It was exactly what I needed. They offered, they offered, they mandated a lot. And at first I looked at the list of things that I was going to have to do. And I was like, I mean, I'm probably not going to be able to show up on time successfully to a Zoom meeting once a month. Honestly, like that's where I was at at that time. But really there was so many different obligations and responsibilities on that list that I had to do or else I would be in violation with the court because I automatically was in court. They were suing me for custody of my son. And so anyways, I had to, I had to get an assessment for drug and alcohol use. I had to, I had to go to treatment as a result of the assessment that determined that I needed inpatient therapy, which I was convinced that I didn't because I had now been sober for over a week. So obviously in my mind, I've been sober for over a week now. I made it my mind for real this time. No, I went to inpatient and that was exactly what I needed. And they also had me engaged with the behavioral health services at Inforbent County. And we met once a week for about an hour for over a year on Zoom or in person. And they taught me parenting skills in a way that was very trauma informed. And that I was able to relate to. Again, it played, like what I learned with them, it played into my understanding of how my life got out of hand and my understanding of how it would be easy for me without healing to allow my son's life to get equally out of hand. And I was really blessed that I had a CPS case there. I had to go to court every month for over a year before and I stayed sober this whole time. I passed every UA. I did all the things, but still they wanted an entire year before they considered, you know, letting me have my rights. And, you know, I did that. And throughout the whole thing, the judge was really nice. And at the end he was like, you're like the poster child for CPS. I mean, I never been a poster child before, but I'll take what I can get. So it went well. I learned things that I never would have learned outside of that. And while I went to treatment at Santa Maria, at first I went by myself. They said that I couldn't bring, you know, that I wasn't going to be able to reunite with him in treatment, that I needed to go by myself and that, you know, I needed to work on myself. And so I did. I went to Jaclyn House, Santa Maria. I and I gave myself to the program. I surrendered. You know, at first I didn't really trust them. I was like, they're going to go report back to CPS. CPS is going to find out about my life and how messed up it really is. And they're going to be like, no, you cannot have a baby. Like, I don't care how long you stay sober, you're a mess. And I'd been on a mess. So I was paranoid, you know, my brain was all whacked out. But I surrendered. I was like, okay, it hit me. If I go in here and I lie my way through treatment, I'm not going to heal. And I really wanted to heal. You know, I really wanted to heal. And so I told the truth and it was hard. And I basically uncovered everything about myself and the treatment. My counselor and my recovery coach advocated for me in court and I was able to in time get my son back with me. I was allowed to be his guardian while basically they placed him with me, but he was still in their custody while I was in treatment at Santa Maria. So they basically they transferred me to the treatment program for women with children. They allowed me to have my son there and I could leave it any time, but I couldn't take him with me. So I didn't leave, obviously. And so I whenever my son was three months old, I was able to be reunited with him. I found out that I was going to get him back on my birthday on October 8th and he was brought and met me at Santa Maria, Benita House on October 9th. On October 9th. And, you know, we've been together every day since then. And I'm so in love with him and he is beautiful and amazing and perfect. It's crazy because I know that my place as a parent is to teach him how to live and teach him how to love. I mean, he's taught me those things, you know. So it's just been a really beautiful experience. I'm doing great in school. I love my job. You know, yeah, life is good. He is my why. And it's crazy because, you know, I hated myself and stuff too, but having him, it's now God forbid I ever lost my son. Don't God forbid that. But I've actually learned to love myself. I've learned to love myself. I know myself and I love myself. And even before my drug addiction, that's not something I've ever been able to say. And I can say that with such honesty now. You have to want it and you have to let somebody know that you want it. And if that person doesn't help you, let somebody else know and keep letting people know until you find somebody that helps you because because it's out there. Because you can't do it yourself. You can't get sober on your own and you definitely cannot stay sober on your own. You need support. That is the most important thing. Yeah. So in my second week of treatment, I wrote this and I didn't even know how true that it was. It's like it's amazing. But I said, um, today I woke up feeling grateful and lucky. I feel excited and capable. I'm so fortunate to have gotten this opportunity to come into recovery. At first, it's kind of hard to take recovery seriously. There have been times in my life when I resented recovery programs and people who acted all excited about recovery just kind of got me annoyed. Before I actually started wanting to get better for me, it all just sounded like a bunch of blah, blah, bullshit. But now I see it differently. We're in such a good, we are in such a good place. We can go anywhere from here. There's a whole staff of people here to help us with anything, any problem we may have. We can get, we can get solved or at least begin to get it resolved here. No matter where you are, you can take what you get here and end up somewhere better. For me personally, this is a relatively new realization. I'm in the beginning phases of recovery. So I'm like scraping the bottom of the recovery barrel, just trying to get all of the toxicity, the poison out. This is the part where I have to force myself to process the uncomfortable feelings I like to pretend don't exist. Because the more I ignore my feelings, the more they directly affect my negative behaviors, thus enabling me to continue screwing up my life. I have to dissect my shame and find the underlying guilt and recognize that I am not the messed up person or the messed up things that I've done. Or the messed up things that have been done to me. And my guilt is what tells me so. It says, Taylor, this feels bad because this does not resonate with you. You're acting out of your own character. So that says I have good character, right? I have to deal with CPS. I have to get my ID. I have to get my birth certificate, my social security card. I have to remove people from my life, probably forever, who I truly felt I couldn't live without. I have to figure out where the hell I am going to live. I have to figure out how the hell I'm going to pay for it. And these are just, and these are the things that overwhelm us. This is what feels bad. But this is the bottom of the barrel of recovery where we start over. We get a vacation and we get to start over the clean slate. Some people, in fact, a lot of people in acts of recovery have already overcome the basic bottom of the barrel things. Once we clean the toxins out of the barrel, only then can we begin to fill it with safe, non-toxic water. And that's when it gets exciting. That's when we can start having something. And when we start having something, that's when we can start giving something to others that's actually healthy and not toxic. And you stay connected with other people who achieve, who started at the bottom of a barrel like yours. And together you can keep going, redefine, redefine your boundaries, redefine your limits, redefine your goals, redefine yourself with the same people or the same type of people who are encouraging you now. And eventually the barrel is going to runneth over. If you keep at it, stay in recovery, just continue to work up after all your current goals are completed. I think I was, I was quarantined at the beginning of my treatment. And yeah, so we were in quarantine and so it was like a lot of time, just like alone with my thoughts and feelings. Not alone. It was also with a few other strangers who were going through similar things. We were all a mess and we were locked in an apartment together. And I had my assignments. I had been given multiple assignments and I was just in the room. I couldn't leave with a bunch of assignments that asked me to look at, look at yourself, you know, and so I could either look and look at myself or look at the walls. And so I was kind of going crazy. But on the other hand, I, there was like a light shining in the room and it was like, but there's hope, you know, for the first time, there's hope. And so that's kind of why it starts out saying, you know, this is the shitty part because that this is the bad part. And so I was, I wrote it and it was like, you know, like my connection with God or my higher self and it was, that's, you know, like what was taking the pen was saying, it's going to be okay. You know, like this is the beginning. This is the, this is the bad part, you know, but there, there's hope. You're just scraping the bottom of the barrel right now. And one day you're going to have something in that barrel that's not toxic anymore. You know, and it's going to, your barrel is going to run it over and you're going to be able to pour into other people's. And so that was, um, that's what, what I got from that. And I wrote it down because it was just so brilliant. It was just coming to me. And then I read it to, you know, the other people in the room and you know, we all got excited together. Yeah. And I carried that with me. I carried that feeling, um, that hope for recovery and what it could be. Um, and I still have that today and my barrel will run us over. You know, um, it does. I'm so happy. Um, my life is really good. I have great people in my life today. Um, yeah. Um, yeah.",loaded_from_file,27842,THE JOURNEY From Addiction to Recovery - Taylor's Story,2311.0,36,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00
ggvveOo6_QU,"I want to tell my story. I want to let you guys know that sobriety is possible. I come from using heroin as my choice drug and I have 11 overdoses and you know I'm lucky to be here. I say lucky even though it's technically blessed you know Jesus has given me a way to be here and the thing is guys it started from my childhood. I lost my mom when I was 14 years old. I didn't have my dad because of the crimes he committed and he was in prison for 11 years and the one thing I wanted was my dad. My brother wasn't there. He was older than me, 11 years older than me and I tried to just look for that fatherly figure you know what I mean? Like a big brother in a sense and I just I couldn't find it and my mom tried her best for me. She, God rest her soul was a beautiful person you know. She gave me what she could but it just wasn't enough for me and when my mom died April 8th 2008 my life just completely took a whole different turn and I tried to fill that void by you know getting high. Started off with weed and then it went to cocaine and then to pills and then from pills to heroin on the foil and then from there to the needle and I remember this was one time back 2012. I shot up for the first time and it was the most insane feeling that I've ever felt in my entire life and I loved it but I was scared and I said to myself that I'm not gonna do that. I promise myself I'm not gonna touch the needle but it was in the back of my head that I felt that that rush that feeling that was just like oh man this is this is insane you know what I mean? And I tried to chase it. It was never the same after that right? So the pain I was trying to the to void is you know my mom not being there why did you leave me? She had liver cirrhosis she you know because she was also a drug addict back in her 20s. She used heroin and she got hepatitis C and you know she was sober for a very long time and then not having my dad with there with her it was kind of hard for her. She was alone trying to raise two boys yeah my brother was a grown man but he was doing bad things and in and out with gang members bringing stuff to the house that you know he shouldn't have been doing and it hurt my mom right? So she decided to drink again to fill that void just like I was trying to fill the void with doing drugs and it eventually took her and I remember it was it was like April I think April 4th 2008 I was going to middle school James Monroe and I was in eighth grade and my mom said me ho I don't feel good my stomach hurts I'm like okay mom I'm gonna stay home and I'm gonna take care of you and one of my good friends Aaron his mom Gail came over and bring her a book and you know said no what you know we're gonna take you to the hospital you don't look good and she sent me with her with her son Aaron and gave us some money we went to the mall cottonwood mall and you know we were just hanging out you know doing what teenagers do right well what ended up happening as we were walking back home and I got a phone call on you know the little flip phones back then and the call was saying we need to go pick you up you need to come see your mom and I then came to the hospital my mom was like real lethargic and she just she wasn't making much sense and she was saying please do good in life you know finish high school you know treat all women with respect and just do those three things for me and I didn't understand went home to my auntie's house that night she went into a coma three days later we had to pull the plug on her and that was the most hardest time in my life you see my mom gasping for air in front of me seeing tears coming down her eyes her hand holding her hand she had strengthened it kind of but started to slowly go away and that forever stuck with me and I was so mad you know I was mad at God honestly I was I'm not gonna lie why did you take my mom from me mom why did you do this to me you know what I mean and then my dad not there because of prison you know I was like why why did you guys do this to me why me you know what I mean and so that's why I started doing drugs to fill that pain really the thing is is I just want to let you guys know that sobriety is possible I've been sober for four years um one thing I will say is I drove my dad crazy every time I would shoot up with meth and heroin you know mixing them two together I would like run out the room slap in my stomach whistling acting like a monkey kind of just crazy you know what I mean it drove him so crazy to the point where he said you know enough is enough and um I'm sure he's told in his story that you know he he said that you know enough is enough and he put it down and I said to him that you know I don't believe you we're gonna get high again I don't believe you it's no it's not two days went by and then I said wow he's actually being serious because I offered the pipe to him you know here you want to hit it you want to hit it you want to hit it just it was on New Year's two days because he was January 2nd and that was the 4th and uh we lived in an apartment full of cockroaches everywhere we slept on a love seat together uh he slept on the left side I slept on the right side we used to put this carpet you know the stuff to make your carpet smell good the white stuff that was a deterrent for the cockroaches they did not like that so we used to spray it around or sprinkle it all around our couch and then we'd spray the walls and things so we they wouldn't be climbing on us and my dad uh he he really was being serious about this so I said okay well you know what is this really what we're gonna do he was like yes so we came to an agreement and um January 4th 2021 I've been sober and I got on my knees and I said please Jesus I know you can show me that you're real I know I I've always known you're there in my life I just didn't really want to believe in you but you know what I mean and um I asked him to take the urges away from me I said I want to stop smoking cigarettes I don't want to get COVID because this is when COVID was going around and uh because I heard if you smoke cigarettes and you get COVID it it was bad in the beginning and I kid you not guys my higher power Jesus Christ took everything away from me all of my urges and I've been able to stay sober for this long you know all glory to God and going to church with sagebrush and just doing the right thing so we're here it's an honor we want to let you know sobriety is possible and that if we could do it if you knew us I gave you some pictures so you can see you'll you'll know you'll know who I was if you if you knew us and I just want to let you know that you can do it also it's it's a beautiful thing some people don't want to believe in a higher power you know Jesus some people don't want to do that what I can say to you is go to a program I mean I went to numerous programs I was in Stout Street I was also in victory outreach I didn't complete these programs but I know that some people if you really want it it really comes from if you really want to get sober if you really want it you can do it you know what I mean and I give all glory to God for mine because this is what's gotten me through it you know it comes from your heart you have to be ready to to surrender and if you can do it it's possible so you know you you you",loaded_from_file,7336,Recovery - Ricardo

hlbQUDdZaOE,"There's a big mystery in this field because it's so disastrous, it's so horrendous, including being measured by overdose deaths, but also the disruption of people's lives, which is so profound and destructive. And you say, well, how does that happen? Why don't people avoid that? I mean, it's clearly, seeing somebody who's life has been taken over by drugs is not a pretty sight. And it's something everybody's seen. And the answer is that this problem is cunning, baffling, and powerful. And the seduction into it is a pretty regular feature. And it isn't, you know, you don't start off by catastrophic events. You start off using drugs with friends, people you know and spend time with. It's not malicious. They're sharing something that is fun that they've had a good time with. And almost invariably, it starts with kids. And the younger they are, the more vulnerable they are. So you get lots of kids who start at 12 and 13, which surprises a lot of people, but that is a very common time to start drugs. And it's not malevolent. It's not started by the drug users. It's started by the drug users who are friends. And they're not meaning to hurt anybody else. They've found something that's fun for them. Nothing bad has happened to them. And they share it with another young person. And that begins the journey. Now, how does it go? Well, it isn't everybody who's going to die of an overdose, but a lot of people do. And sometimes they'll die very early in it, but not often. Most overdoses are in people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, not among kids. It does happen to kids. And kids do die also. But it's a seduction. And as it goes along, a couple of things happen that are very important. One is that people use more of the drug, and they also spread it to doing other drugs. And it isn't as if it's all just about marijuana or cannabis. Oftentimes that's a starter. Alcohol can be a starter. Cigarettes can be a starter, or nicotine. But it's a whole array of chemicals and lots of different effects of it. But they all have one thing in common. And that is they change the brain, and mostly they work by triggering pleasure and very intensely much more than anything else. And so that's how people get into it. And what's amazing to me about it also, and first of all, that inter-attection, that's remarkable how it is, how even though the people have seen bad things happen to other people, the people they're dealing with have not had bad things happen to them. The down and out addict is not spreading the disease because nobody wants to look like him or her. It's the people who are starting out in it, who are doing it, and it's fun and it's something new. But the other thing that is really very interesting about this is when people have had a lot of problems with drugs and bad things have happened to them, and they go into a rehab and they come out and they're not using drugs, you think that what would happen at that point would the person would say, wow, that was a bad thing I got into. I'm never going to do that again. And yet the most common outcome of rehab is relapse. The percentage of people who relapse is very, very high, way over half, and usually pretty quickly. Sometimes it takes a while, but oftentimes it doesn't. Now how can that be? How can you have a person who has been rescued from chemical slavery and has a clear path ahead of him or her is going to go back to using? That doesn't make any sense at all. That's again this cunning, baffling, and powerful disease. It takes over the person's thinking. And of course the first time the person uses, oftentimes nothing terrible happens, but very quickly they go back into it again. And I gave the example of the first time, how about the tenth time they've been in rehab? It still is like that. So okay, Bob Buchbauer, you've been about this for a long time. What do you do about that? What does that mean? Well, first of all, what it means to me is most people doing treatment programs, I'm not going to say they don't know about relapse, but they underestimate it. They've been the best for the people there, and then some people do stop. It does. But what's missing in that is that the person isn't fixed. It isn't like you've had a disease, and you've gone in and you've gotten disease taken care of, and it's gone. It's not gone. And that's because the brain doesn't forget. And the slippery slope is there, and people will do it over and over again. What can it be done to stop that? Well, there are sort of two basic ways of doing it. One is that people can use medications to deal with opiates, and they can stay on the medications like the methadone, for example, or buprenorphine. And that'll help, but there's still a lot of people that will go on. And now, what I'm going to tell you now, it took me 20 years in this field to come to this, because when I started, I didn't know what Alcoholics Anonymous was. I didn't know what Narconics Anonymous was. I knew about treatment. I'm a doctor. That's something else that's over on the other side. That's, I wouldn't say it's voodoo, but it's not science. It's not what I was interested in. But I had the benefit of having my own patients that I worked with over the course of many years. And these patients educated me. I remember one patient looked at me in the eye, and if we'd come in for several times, he says, doc, I don't think you really get this. Now, I'm a former White House drug czar. I'm a professor of psychiatry at Georgetown Medical School. And this patient says to me, you don't get it. Well, he was right, and I was wrong. And I didn't get it. And I'm appreciative of the other people in the field who don't get it. God bless them, because I was certainly there. So what is this discovery that I've made? Well, I'm proud to be an American for a lot of reasons. I'm actually pretty patriotic and a lot of respect for the country. But one of the things that I'm most proud about as an American is what happened in Akron, Ohio in the summer of 1935. And that was the creation of Alcoholics Anonymous by a salesman and surgeon who had had long-term problems with alcohol and who developed a strategy for dealing with that called Alcoholics Anonymous. Alcoholics Anonymous then, because it had what they called single as a person, they were just talking about alcohol. That's the way they started. But they found out that a lot of people were using other drugs, and even after they stopped drinking, they would use the other drugs and have problems with them. So they discovered it was one problem, and they started another program called Narcotics Anonymous, which was the drug side of it. So the two of them together. And people go back and forth between those two very easily, because they're basically using the same approach. They're two 12-step programs, is what they're called. And this is the perfect American gift to the world, because there's no money involved. The richest person goes to the same meetings as the poorest person. You don't have to have health insurance. It doesn't cost anything. Nobody is getting paid. There's no boss. There's no training program for it. There's no license. No certification. It's just people getting together to help each other using a system that was developed initially in Akron, Ohio in 1935. That's amazing. And it's not a fix. Nobody, everybody in AA and NA knows there's no fix. You're going to have that problem for the rest of your life. Now you can manage it, and the key to manage it is not using. Not using it all. Not cutting down. Not stopping this drug or that drug. And by the way, all the scientists do single drugs. All our diagnoses, you know, opiate use disorder, alcohol use disorder, cannabis use disorder. But the patients aren't one drug. Any drug will do. So recovery means none at all. Zero. And why do they do that? Because they've discovered that using any of the drugs is triggering the same brain mechanism and it's subject to the relapse and all the things that come from that. And the other thing that I had no idea of all my years of practice and seeing patients and everything, didn't understand this. There's a lot more wrong with the person who's using drugs and has an addiction problem than that you're using drugs. And if there's a lot more right with a person in recovery, they're not using drugs. The person who's using drugs to the level of creating the kind of problem that we're calling addiction is a different person. And that person is self-centered, difficult to deal with, all kinds of things that are involved in that character of that person. And when that same person is in recovery, they're generous. They think about other people. There's a whole different person that you're dealing with. It's part of the miracle of recovery and it's a wonderful gift to the world. Now somebody can say to me, okay, Bob DuPont, so you've had this lightning strike you and you've seen all this, but this is just something over the side. What's really going on to deal with this epidemic hasn't to do with those meetings. It has to do with this medicine or this vaccine or whatever it is that's going on, coming from science. I say, okay. But 30 years into the field, I asked myself, how good could outcomes be? Because the most striking thing about treatment of addiction is relapse. This is a disease. How could it possibly be? What would be the best it ever is? And I had the experience in my practice of having doctors as patients who were going to the state physician's health programs. Now a doctor in this country who has an alcohol or drug problem is going to go to the Board of Medicine where their license is. And they're going to get referred to the state physician's health program. Every state has got a physician's health program. And they're all different, but they're all the same also. And they'll do an evaluation of the doctor, the physician. Does he or she have a substance use disorder? If they do, then they're going to go to intensive treatment, typically a 30-day or 60-day or 90-day residential, but it could be outpatient. But anyway, they decided this is the best treatment for this person. And then for five years, five years, they're going to be subject to random testing so that every day for five years, they're subject to be testing and they're done on a random basis. And they get up in the morning and they see whether they have to have testing or not. This is every doctor in the country has this system. It's what they deal with. And then after five years, if they haven't used any drugs and had any problem there, and if they have a relapse, then they're going to go back to treatment again. Okay, how do they do with that? Now think about this. So first of all, I'll tell you that half of them roughly are alcohol of the doctors. A third are opiates and a sixth is everything else. So mostly it's opiates and alcohol that are being treated. And the treatment is the same for both. Same for both. Okay. 78% of those doctors never had a single missed or positive test in five years. Now think about that in relation to other patient populations. Come on. 78% random tested for five years and never had a missed or positive test. You don't have a real results like that. Nobody's got results like that. Well, why is this? Maybe because doctors are smarter. I don't know, not smarter. They have the same rates of addiction as anybody else does, actually. And it's because there's leverage there. The leverage is their practice, their livelihood. It's on the line. And by the way, it isn't just doctors. Commercial pilots have the same kind of approach too. And sometimes lawyers do, but not quite as much as the pilots and the doctors. And why is it pilots and doctors? Because of the concern for the public safety of the addicted person. That's why you get into this. But it's a very important thing. So somebody said to me, well, but that's why all this, what happens afterwards? What happens after they finish? And they do relapse from time to time, but very unusual. But what's most interesting is we asked them, what was the most important thing to you, this is five years after their last mandatory test, five years after the last mandatory test, we asked them, what was the most important thing to you in your getting recovering from this disease? And they had treatment, those treatment that they had at the beginning where they were in the residential treatment mostly, that was very important to them. Twice as high as that was going to AA and NA meetings. Now this is doctors. The doctors are going to the meetings. All of them were essentially are going to meetings. Not as a occasional person, but all of them were going to meetings. Why is that? Why did they ever get that program? How did that happen to be so different from what happens to everybody else? And the answer was that program was not started by experts like me. That program was started by doctors who were themselves in recovery. That's why it's so tough. It's not so tough to punish them. It's so tough because that's the disease we're trying dealing with. And that's what it takes to get people's attention and change their behavior. And I like to think that those doctors in their experience and God bless them are helping us understand the disease and what you do about it and what the recovery is like. And because these doctors are the ones that I've worked with quite exemplary, quite impressive. But anyhow, back to the basic message here.

jpTkDrHNuNA,"I was abused as a child sexually and I really didn't know how to deal with it. I was in and out of the psych center and heavily medicated and some of my friends were like, hey, why don't you try this? And I did. How did that work out? It numb the pain and it was an escape for a long time. But it ended in me trying to take my own life. I knew I was addicted to things before I started using drugs because they started me on Ritalin when I was a kid, first grade. And I remember just the ups and the downs from that. I would get like a high and then when I would come off of it, it's like I needed more even as a kid, you know? I couldn't really function without it. Being a child and being prescribed to such a strong medication, I feel like it almost wires your brain to be an addict because it's speed. I mean, it helped me concentrate and it's calmed me down, but the real problem was still there. The real problem was I was abused. And so as you got older, you started getting into... Well, it started out weed and then pills. Of course, cocaine, you know, that was a drug of choice because I was on Ritalin my whole life. So I was looking for speed, you know? I was used to functioning at a much faster pace. So this normal life and no drugs, it felt weird. And then it went to alcohol, heroin, crack. Whatever I could get my hands on that would numb the pain, I was going to take it. And I didn't care what it cost me because I was living in turmoil my whole life. So I needed to get away. Did you have any resemblance of a normal life during this time or were you more... I don't even know what a normal life would look like. I've seen it on TV, what people look like normal. And I can't imagine what that's like. I have an idea of what it's like now at 46. I mean, I had dreams of things I desired to do, maybe. But each day I was just trying to get through the day and I want to kill myself. And I was in and out of the psych center my whole entire life. How did you wind up in there? Who would put you there? Would you put yourself there? No, my mother would. My mother and my stepfather and... until they couldn't and then... I would get arrested. I mean... Or I would do something that would put me in the psych center. I usually try to take my life. What helped? Well, I tried to take my life about eight years ago and I was on life support for four days. And when I came out of the medically induced coma that they had me in, I realized it didn't work. And God had me here for a reason. And no matter how many times I would try to take myself out, he wasn't ready for me to leave here. So I got locked in with a church. I got married. My husband's a big influence in my life for knowing Christ. And my church is a big influence in my life. Having a relationship with the Lord. Was that your first time involved in church? It was my first time with a relationship with Jesus Christ. I believed before, but I did not have a relationship. I still was medicated. I was still in therapy and prescribed medications. And I wasn't coming to it with a clear, clear thinking. It seems like you spent a lot of your developmental years in a kind of a fog. Yeah, you could say that. It almost doesn't even seem like it's my life. It seems like I was just there. It wasn't even my life. I was under the influence pretty much since first grade of medications, prescribed medications, or drugs. What are you thinking now? Just wow, how far God has brought me. I'm grateful. I'm grateful to still be alive. Because a lot of my friends aren't. They didn't find your path. They didn't. God chose me. And now I die to myself every day to live for Him. I was seeking God like I was seeking those drugs. So when you quit, was there a detox process that was difficult? Yeah, the detox wasn't as bad as some of the drugs I've come off of. I had dealt with a great deal of pain, so I was taking Suboxone and coming off of cocaine. So it wasn't as bad as it could have been. It was still hard. So where are you at now? A place I never thought I would be. I never knew how to get where I am. I just didn't know how to get to it. People told me, just trusting the Lord. And I did, but I just didn't. I couldn't get over the hump. I couldn't lay everything down. I still wanted to do it my way. But His too, and that didn't work. But you're in a good place now. I'm in a great place now. Great. What's so great about it? I feel free. I feel like all the chains that the enemy had on me are broken off. I feel like I can actually live. How's the living going? It's great. Recovery is hard. It's a hard process. But if you seek the Lord like you were seeking the drugs, it makes it a lot easier. It makes it easier. I mean, I'm just thankful for where I'm at. What is it that people who want to be in recovery but are not, what is it they need to know? That they can do it. It seems impossible. I know they're scared, but they can do it. Why can't they do it? Because if I can do it, I know anybody can do it. If you really want to get clean, you really want to start putting your family first and everyone that loves you, then you can do it. I'll tell you this, I could have done it without God. That's one thing I know. I've tried to do it myself every other way. But until I put Him first, and I mean before everything, I could not do it. That's what changed everything. Thank you. Thank you.",loaded_from_file,5379,April's Story - Recovery and Faith,686.0,2,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00
KQsotPbJ2mw,"So where does your story begin? Oh, so I guess my childhood, I mean it wasn't the best childhood. Both parents were pretty abusive to each other, but not so much to us. We were both alcoholics and I think just kind of seeing them pretty much beat up on each other all the time. It just really gave me an unstable environment anyways. So moving forward, I really just wanted to not be like them so much that I just focused on not being an alcoholic. I was like oblivious to everything else and then before I knew it, I was hooked on Percocet. My friend's mom, we were 15, she would give us Percocet to give us energy to clean. So I just thought it was something fun to do and then before I knew it, I knew what withdrawal was. Yeah, yeah. And then so of course that leads to just the whole chasing the high and doctor shopping and just chaos. Before that, I was 13, my dad passed away from drinking. So that was something that just should have rocked me and it should have been talked about, but it wasn't. And it just kind of got suppressed. So then I'm still in, I go into the pills and all that and I'm partying and doing everything I'm not supposed to do. And then by the time I'm 21, my mom just randomly passes away and that's due to alcohol too. So I'm just mad. I'm frustrated. I don't understand. And then I end up in jail and I go to a back in front of the judge and the girl that was going before me was like, oh, he denied me for this program and I was going up for the same program. And I was like, oh man, and he gave it to me and he said, you know what, I'm going to give you enough rope, either you're going to hang yourself or you're not. And if you come back in here, I'm giving you all your time. Well, it was a faith based program and it really gave me the foundation I needed. But then again, I got out, I had my daughter and I just started having this, oh, I got this attitude and I did not have it. And before I knew it, I was, you know, popping Adderall and that led to meth. And then I lost my daughter and then I was in like a deeper hole than I was before. And I was just like, oh, here I am again, like stuck on something else. And I thought heroin and pills were hard to get off of, but meth was just, it just, I don't even know. It was like, I was so confident and I was like feeling myself, but then it slowly like started getting worse and worse. And my now husband was actually my drug dealer. So that in itself is amazing to me. But yeah, so we were on meth and we were living that great life. We thought we had the cars and the money and all of that, but we were just still empty on the inside. I mean, I didn't have my daughter. I just felt hopeless really like I just didn't want to be here. So he, we lost the house. We lost the cars. We didn't have water. We didn't have power. Like we were just barely even making it. And finally one day my husband was like, I'm done. And I was like, what do you mean you're done? And he was like, I'm not doing it anymore. And I was like, okay, well, he did. He stuck to it and he stopped. And I just, I couldn't still like a year in of him being clean. I was still using and then I picked up a gambling habit on top of that. And yeah, he just, he stuck by me and he knew I was using and he just was really leaning on God at the time. And I was like, well, I did the God thing and it didn't work for me. Like look at me now. So I was mad really that he was getting it and I wasn't. And I ended up going to an outpatient program where they just, I don't even know, they just saw something in me that I didn't see in myself. And I mean, I put them through the ringer. They, they just, I would fill urine screens. I would, you know, just do everything I wasn't supposed to do. And they would still be like, you know what, it's fine. It's fine. Just keep coming back. Until one day Chad comes home and I'm about to use and he just catches me red handed. And I remember thinking two days before that, like, man, if Chad would just catch me, I swear I'll stop. I swear I'll stop and lo and behold, he caught me. And yeah, he just, he was really calm. He didn't yell at me. He didn't chastise me. He was like, you know, your daughter deserves to have you in her life. And he just said, I really advise you throw that away. And I was like, yeah, right. Well, that was two days before Christmas. So I said, I'm going to get through the holidays and I'll stop. And I did. And it's been great. I was already done. Like I was just sick of it. You know, I was just tired of hiding it. I was tired of feeling like I just was never going to get out of it. You know, I was tired of being depressed and I just wanted to be on the same page as my husband. We got married. Like he asked me to marry him while I was still using and he knew I was still using. I was like, what is this guy doing? Like it's not going to work. But um, so throughout all that had been five years that I was completely absent from my daughter's life. Like they, her aunt didn't want me to be around her or anything. And at the time I was like, oh, she's just, she's wrong. She's just trying to steal my kid. And like that was the drugs talking. I mean, golly, I couldn't even pass a hair follicle test for her. You know, I'm sitting there trying to figure out ways to clean my hair to be able to pass instead of just stopping using. Like it was crazy. And um, so that was a year and a half ago I got to see my daughter for the first time and it's great. And everything is just really falling into place. Like we have a relationship now and I just, I couldn't be happier. So what was that like? Um, it was first week or two. How was that? I slept a lot. My husband actually came home and he was like, look, I know you're going to sleep and eat. I just bought $200 worth of groceries. Lay down, just eat, do what you got to do. And I did. And I slept a lot and there was a lot of hissy fits and tears and just an emotional roller coaster. One minute I was happy. The next minute I was screaming and yelling at him. Blessed man's heart. It was, it was rough. I know it was on him and me, mostly him probably because I just was not trying to, it just sucked all around. I mean, there's no really way to sugarcoat it. Probably after the first week, like I started to feel myself again and I was actually wanting to get out of the bed and I wasn't depressed. Like I felt like I was making progress for once. And yeah, I just, I knew I was like, finally I'm going to do it. And he like, it wasn't, I wasn't hiding it or anything because before I would try to hide detoxing and he would think I was just, I would say I had the flu or something like that, which he wasn't dumb, but you know, you think they are. And um, yeah, it was just, I knew, I knew I was done. I knew it. I couldn't even think about imagining myself going back now, not now. It's not worth it. It's really just, I've gained too much back to backtrack. And besides, you know, one of the last year in screens I took when I was still using had fit and all in it and I wasn't even doing fit and all. Like it's just that stuff is in everything. And I didn't want to go out like that. I couldn't. That had to be pretty scary. It should have been, but it wasn't at the time I was just like, oh, I'll just make sure I test it before I do it. Yeah. But now thinking about it, yeah, I'm like, wow, you know, I'm lucky to be alive. So now I am, of course, happily married. Um, I'm an active parent. Uh, I get to pick my daughter from school and we go places and I'm planning birthday parties with her aunt. We co-parent and, uh, we are actively trying to have a baby. And I am in the process of being a peer recovery specialist to help people that are coming out of addiction just like I did. Is your husband doing that too? Peer recovery? No, he's a pipe fitter, but he takes a lot of younger men that come out of the same stuff under his wing all the time. He's always on the phone with them. Like, yeah, that's kind of what we do. We open our home to people. We were just 24 seven around the clock if you need us, we're there. You got to give it back because had I had someone maybe that was willing to, or I did have someone that was willing to stick it out with me. And it works. You just got to be patient. You can't just give up on somebody as soon as they mess up because it comes with the territory. Just love them. Yeah. Yeah. That's what my husband used to tell me. He was like, I'm literally just going to love that thing right out of you. And he did. You didn't really have any experience with like going to rehab or anything? So I did the faith based rehab or they released me to the program, but no, not really. I just always wanted to do it at home. I probably could have gotten clean sooner had I done the rehab thing, but I was just hard headed and prideful. Yeah, that pride will get you every time really. And it's that fear of being locked up and not being able to get out and use. It's ridiculous. It really was, but luckily, yeah, by the grace of God. There you are. Yeah. So what's what's that? What's that one most important thing that people should take from this people that are wanting to be in recovery or people who are just starting recovery? What's. Oh, so for me, it was the God piece. I mean, I tried every route. So why not try God? I mean, I tried to act like I had it all together by myself and obviously that didn't work. So now I'm very, very active in the church and I lean on God for everything and it's it's worked for me. And I know it'll work for anyone that gives it a try. Is it easy? No. It's never going to just be rainbows and butterflies. And that's kind of the mindset we go into like, oh, I'm clean now. So everything should just fall into place. It doesn't. But once you start doing the right things, it will. And you'll look back and you'll be like, wow, man, I did that. So now even like the biggest setback, I'm just like, it's cool. It could be so much worse. Was church new to you? Um, so. Or kind of new? When I went to the recovery program. Um, yeah. Oh yeah, it was, it was very new. I'd never cracked a Bible. So you would have had some preconceived notions about it, though, I would think. What do you mean? About church. Um, like what my thoughts about it. Yeah, like, like you did. But maybe skeptical. Oh yeah, for sure. I mean, honestly, when they first released me to that program, I was just kind of like, take it out. I'm just going to fake it till I make it. That's horrible. But it was, and when I got there, the, I'll never forget the first day we were having like a devotion or something. It was like a night church service. And I'd never seen church people do anything. And I was like, oh, wow, I think I'm ready to go back to jail. I'm in a cold. I didn't know. But the, my overseer told me, she was like, you know, just give it two weeks. And if you don't like it, we'll find something else for you in two weeks. And I was like, okay, I think I can, I think I can get used to this. So there were some surprises to it. Yeah. Yeah. It was, I was at peace. Yeah. And then, you know, I graduated and then forgot everything I learned there. And that's when everything crumbled again. And here I am. And now you're good. Yeah. Now I'm good. It's like lesson learned. Yeah.",loaded_from_file,11327,Recovery - Lesson Learned-Ashley Hughes' Story,889.0,49,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00
L-aAo5HvPrY,"My little brother died. Fentanyl took him from me two years ago when my mom's backyard was on May 20th. He had just got out of rehab and he was home for five days and you know Fentanyl had already kind of made its way around the area you know we were already here in a heavy amount of fatalities from Fentanyl poisoning overdose. He was home five days, he was in my mom's backyard, he was locked out because he had just got dropped off. My mom wasn't home and his phone was not working because he had got wet so it was in a bag of rice in the backyard on the counter. So he had no way to call anybody but he had got a Xanax and it turns out it wasn't Xanax, it was Fentanyl. So he had been in rehab so his system it kind of became clean over this time and you know he took it it was too much for him and as the onset came on to him he knew it and he grabbed the security camera and he looked in the camera and he said why me? He said why me? Then he set the camera down and it collapsed. My mom showed up 45 minutes later his vomit was dried in his eyes and his nose. She tried to give him CPR, paramedics came, they tried. It was over, he was just gone. 32 years old. Travis Bishop and then four months later same thing happened to my best friend. He had been clean for a year. His name was Brendan Copper. He actually gave my little brother his nickname and his older brother was fighting a fentanyl addiction and we were working together to make it through the stages of recovery which is a very daunting process if you don't know already how to navigate the world of recovery but so he was in the process and it was it was on Brendan's birthday October 19th and he was there just he had the death rattle he was on on a chair and they called paramedics and again it was too late and I had to go tell his brother Rudy Copper that night that he lost his brother so the same thing I lost my brother too and ultimately that's why I'm here right now. He always and he always looked up to me he always looked up to me you always kind of followed in my footsteps you know he loved music I love music he loves his kids I mean we used to skateboard you know we used to just do everything you know we're close. We do kind of have a reputation and a party reputation here in Pensacola as far as for younger generations coming up it's hard to find something to do and I know for me personally my dad was in the Navy and we moved around a lot and it was hard for me to I didn't have like a group of friends I grew up with and then so by the time I got here but I was very cultured I saw a lot of different things I you know the friends I would make every all the different places would be you know every different color or ethnicity you know it was that was normal for me and when I got down here and we kind of settled here my dad decided he didn't want to travel anymore for the Navy well he traveled he but this is where he wanted to remain so he left us here he still traveled a little bit from there but this is where we grew up and it was hard for me to kind of settle in on who my friends were everybody already kind of had their own clicks and you know there was a little more segregation to which wasn't something I could really grasp at the time you know I just I have it was all blurred to me so you know I had a hard time finding out where I fit in and that was what led me to the you know parties you know how do you fit in you start by getting drunk with everybody you know that's kind of the culture here it's a lot different now than it was then but there was always a bunch of bars and much of clubs cocaine and in ecstasy were very popular at the time but I ended up finding a career that it required drug tests hair follicle tests and I made the commitment I already had kids at the time so I made the commitment and I went down that path I went offshore and this was about the time that OxyCotten showed up so it's like I sailed out right at the time that that thing exploded that whole thing because before that you could hear about a perc set here or there but lords have to really popular and even like the coding the lean cough syrup that wasn't even popular at the time OxyCotten shows up while I'm offshore and so now I'm here and back home every now and then somebody's dying somebody's overdose that's something we never really heard of and even before that heroin was really unheard of around here there was little pockets but it was not something that was really here like you know it wasn't popular and that's also the time that the the pills and doctor shopping started taking place you know once OxyCotten came around this new doctor shopping thing came around and so a lot of my friends would do that as friends I couldn't really keep up with or hang out anymore with because I was on this career and I have you know this family so it was just things I was seeing and hearing about you know back home and you know over the years more people were dying then you know fentanyl the word fentanyl started popping up and at first it was like just a super scary thing I was hearing about like nobody's gonna wants to do that but it's ending up and stuff it's just killing everybody like nobody wants to do it and that's before I realized that you know how how addictive it is that I had no idea I had no idea I had I was so far removed from what is taking place on the streets today I was watching that through social media from out in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico just seeing what's happening so you know I was only getting that part of the story meanwhile not knowing that you know some the people that I love the most you know growing up and everything but are actually living a life revolving around fentanyl addiction actually being addicted to fentanyl you know because in my mind why would anybody do that it's such a deadly thing that's all you hear about at one point time that's all we heard about the news and this is before I even had a comprehension that that was possible before I knew about people being able to press whatever kind of pill they want in there in their room at their house in order to materials online like this was before all this was was known to me it was just all it was just a scary thing why would anybody do it it's killing everybody I was completely ignorant until the point of losing my brother and once I lost my brother I had this type of pain that wanted some sort of retribution some way and you know we were standing at the at the casket for my brother me Rudy and even Brendan Rudy's older brother that passed away in October we're standing at the casket and we said we have to do something about this we all agreed but none of us knew what we were gonna do but we've done a lot since that point you know at that point I became immersed I went down the rabbit hole as far as I could go and then I went back and you know just trying to figure out how to undo the quilt of what's happening why is everybody dying why are we addicted how do you get out of an addiction to fentanyl what are the resources how do you navigate recovery because I'd already been through the experience once with Rudy of trying to go door to door to all the substance use recovery things I could find in the phone book going to the wrong place each time you know just that that could get to the point where somebody would give up you know for me it didn't hurt my feelings as much but bringing somebody somewhere that's willing to go into recovery getting rejected from door is a hard space to navigate if you don't know you know just stepping in trying to find out without ever experiencing it it's very hard to find out where to go what we found out well Escambia County they have a pilot program they're piloting here there's actually in several counties I don't know if they're all doing the same thing that we're doing in Escambia County but it is the best weapon against a fentanyl addiction it's called the core program and it's a paramedic and a nurse and what they can do is they can do a street intervention with somebody who is withdrawing who's already in the withdrawal phases they have a scale they use to measure where they are with and withdrawals and then they can give them subutex and then they can come back and check on them each day and I'll actually sit there with them and wait until the withdrawal symptoms stabilize and then check on them the next day and then I get them appointment with with community health or with the Lakeview so that they can continue their suboxone treatment but this way it's an opportunity for people who are struggling with a fentanyl addiction can get out and not have to go through the withdrawal phase they can they can ease over onto MAT and that really has been the the best weapon against fentanyl addiction here and I hope that other counties other municipalities will kind of follow suit in this because it's the withdrawal is in order someone somebody's addicted to fentanyl everybody's different but there's still waves there's still you know when you're high and then when you're withdrawing and only during the withdrawal phase is can you even have a conversation about recovery and so it's like the Swiss cheese the holes in the Swiss cheese all have to line up in order for somebody to make that step but then that that moment is so fleeting that if something can't happen in that window of time that individual has to go back and find some fentanyl they have to and so that's another reason why this core program you can call them and say I'm withdrawing you know I don't want to do this anymore and then they will come out to that individual anywhere in the Scambia County and they will dose them with subutics and monitor their withdrawals make sure they don't go in to precipitate withdrawals as well and you know ease into a treatment plan a lot of people here didn't know about it and we found out about it we kind of you know made a deal with them because they're just you know there are two people that drive around in SUV and sometimes they end up in places they're kind of uncomfortable for them you know it hard to you know especially encampments and things like that but you know we've been working together great to with our outreach team that we have now going out into these places and make sure people are able to just transition over to MAT and get out from underneath the fentanyl and the chase and be able to start living a manageable life that's that conversation that we had at the coffin at the casket that's the that's the conversation we have from my brother that is offensive core it's called offensive core with a it has a T in the middle OFF ENT SIV and for a lot of reasons off FENT offensive we're going on the offensive being on the defense we're dying out here we're doing something proactive to reduce the numbers of deaths by fentanyl and so that's that's the name that's the meaning behind the name where it started was Rudy started giving his testimony on social media and he's got an incredible story he's got a lot of assets from the things that he's lived through and so that's how it started the Facebook page YouTube where we were just taking little sections of his story and releasing it out and you know we gained a little bit of a following there and so when Rudy how the idea for what came next we got to rewind a little bit Rudy was was addicted to fentanyl he was out on the streets you know his legs were falling off and I would go into camps and motels and different places looking for him and just try to like shake him say hey come on stop doing this let's go you know I didn't know anything at the time but I would bring them things you know and you know just kind of make sure he's okay and go about my business until we find he got to a point where he was able to get into the waterfront here so now fast forward back to offensive core we started out with street outreach it was something we did not see being done but it was something that was basically me going looking for Rudy in these camps in these motels now I was taking other people including Rudy into camps and motels and trying to find people that are ready for recovery or what kind of barriers they're facing and this and that and just trying to uncover them that way you know trying to get people back into the economy get people off the streets off of drugs get their mental health addressed and so again my personal experience trying to navigate the world of recovery all the closed doors or all the wrong doors I went to I went down that rabbit hole figuring out who's who and who does what you know I became obsessed with it because I needed to know because if somebody needed that I needed to get them to that it was just so and that's what we would go out into these camps and these motels and we would bring that information to them we would bring Narcan food clothes clean supplies and you know we would build relationships that led to recovery because we learn there's a lot of stigma towards you know the traditional means of recovery there's there's a lot of stigma there's a lot of stigma so and it's both ways and I don't just mean one you know the recovery side looking down on the people that are in the addiction it's also the other way to the people that are still in addiction they don't they have a stigma against traditional recovery organizations and law enforcement and all these things that that it's there in you so it's a barrier and here we're coming in neutral you know we were able to build these relationships we're all peers we're all people with lived experience so it it also breaks down that barrier where we're able to create these relationships in these camps and things like that through that we we came across some human trafficking situations and we were able to help get some folks out of these situations and again ran into the same scenario every single door we went to to try to find a place to take these individuals closed doors so that actually that situation a human trafficking victim in my truck listening to me get rejected left and right by all these human trafficking victim services for this individual I had nobody else to call and now offensive we already had an office so where we're you know kind of headquarters where we gather all our supplies that we take out and everything and she was like can I just put a tent in your backyard which that thought never occurred to me never made sense why would anybody want to live in a tent well one one you want to go to a shelter but the reality is it was gonna be a tent out on the streets where the same scenario can take place again where she could end up in that same situation again if she even had a tent it could be a sidewalk and so it made no sense in the world in my head for me to say no how could I say no how there's no way I could have said no and that grew into to a whole camp we actually have a whole camp for for women that are unsheltered and vulnerable to abuse assault and trafficking you know we kind of reinforced that with our peer specialist case management type stuff we don't really case management is kind of a sensitive word to a lot of the people we serve so we don't really say that a whole lot but we're peer specialists and we do goal-oriented goal-oriented achievement we have goal-oriented achievement technicians we call them goats so they're like a case manager but you know to them a lot of case managers mean somebody that could take your kids from you or somebody that could put you in jail so there's a stigma on that so we but just to put it in perspective of what we're doing but we uncover barriers in it's not a plan where we just have a bit all written down and we just fill in the blanks it we have to ask this individual what their barriers are in order to uncover them and in order to get through them we can't tell them what their problems are or what they've got in their way or why they're there it has proven a lot more successful than with this approach with you know just making sure that the opportunities aren't on a table and you can pick if something you see fit something that you need so that's what the camp has grown into we've got them and that came from our street outreach as well you know the going into these camps and coming across and that taught us something as well we need more structured camps you know just in general to help people get a low barrier camps because we do have great shelters here but they're not low barrier so people currently struggling with mental health people currently struggling with substance use can't just walk into these shelters because they have to address those issues first and especially with mental health on the streets being unsheltered getting to an appointment is impossible having a phone you don't have a phone you can't even fathom keeping an appointment let's say you made it to your appointment somebody got you to your appointment somehow you got medication that medication is going to be stolen or is just it's not going to make it through the night never does we've witnessed this over and over again especially a female so there is no chance to get stabilized with the mental health there is no opportunity because there's no stability there's no security and then with our camp we're finding that you know now people are able to get through these mental health crisis and get stabilized you know get on their medications and things like that in a safe place and getting into permanent housing and where previously people thought that they would they were a loss cause it there's no way this person will ever be normal again and it's pretty unbelievable and I you know that conversation at that casket I had no idea what it you know it was really going to lead to none of us did and we also have two men's homes the way we view that is as a step out of the shelters you know a congregate shelter to where there's less people but there's front yard backyard kitchen you know freedoms you know come and go as you please so that's that's what offensive has has become and we actually have a meeting with the mayor on Thursday to discuss a new property because currently our camp which we call Camp O camp offensive we're packed out we we can't we can't accommodate any more people and there's more people than you know and so we've got a new property that we're about to to establish Camp O to you know kind of like oxygen but it's a bigger camp it's in the woods it's really nice and we'll be able to over double our capacity now yeah it's kind of what offensive is has ended up and that's this is what you know this is what fentanyl has done you know just sent me on this trajectory you know I did kind of brand my I have marketing skills so I brought that into what we're doing you know to make sure that the right people hear it and that we are reducing stigma and that we're getting it out to the masses we went viral a few times for some of our videos they're kind of edgy they're kind of sugaring but it's the real life I mean I'm sorry that you know there's a lot of people going through this and like ignoring it and just putting our two cents in when we haven't even tried to navigate getting somebody into recovery but we realized a lot had to change and so we use our social media presence to to make those changes if you love someone if you have a loved one that that's struggling don't disable them I think we we as a culture we heard we were condemned for being enablers you know at one point it was a it was this horrible thing to be an enabler and we all became disablers we actually started causing injury to the people that we love that are struggling and now they're dying so if there is one message I would like to get out there it would be to just get rid of the stigma around the enabler propaganda it didn't work a lot of people are dead you",loaded_from_file,19909,FENTANYL KILLS - Brad Bishop - My Brother's Keeper - episode

L-nd2_yglog,"I'm here to tell my story and hopefully, you know, give some body else hope that they can overcome everything that they've been through and build a beautiful life for themselves regardless of what they've faced. So my story begins at a very young age. I come from a really dysfunctional family. My family was heavy in addiction, heavy in alcoholism. A lot of mental health issues in my family. So from a very early age, it was complete chaos for me. My way of, quote, unquote, discovering myself, I felt like when I was 13 was addiction. I started addiction at a very early age in life. I had learned at an early age that if you sell drugs, you can make money. And I come from a poor family. And so at 12 years old, I was selling pills on the streets. I was selling oxy, oxy cotton, percocets, things like that. You know, I had bottles and bottles of pills that I was allowed to get my hands on. And I figured out, hey, I can, I can sell these and I can make money and I can, I can have stuff for my self, you know, I grew up in a poor family, but I went to a school where kids had money and I always felt kind of left out and well, why, why don't I have these things? So I found a way to make money and, and then I started wondering, well, well, why do people buy these? Why do people spend money on these pills? What do they do? And I took one. I'd suck in oxy cotton at 13 years old and it was the escape I had been searching for, you know, all my life and through all the chaos that I was going through. And from there, it just, it escalated completely. It went from pills. Then I was running away. I was hanging out with people three times my age. I remember being at parties where I wasn't afraid of anything because chaos was all I knew and anything to escape, I was all for it. I remember going to parties and there would be lines of cocaine and then the line of Xanax and then a line of cocaine. And I would just back to back to back to back to back, you know, until I just blacked out and didn't know where I was, who I was, got myself in some really bad situations like that. But that's where, that's where it all started for me. That's how it all began. Definitely where I lacked control in my life. That's exactly where I found control because even though I was doing something that harmed me, I had control in doing that. Like nobody else was doing that but me. It gave me a sense of almost like knowing who I was when I didn't know who I was. It was a lie. It was a false belief that I had some sort of power over my own life, you know, whether that be good or bad. I dived in really hard. I was doing hard drugs right from the get go as I got older. The selling drugs became more dangerous, getting myself involved with people I shouldn't have been involved with traveling from state to state at 15 years old, missing school, not going to school, coming home long enough to not get truancy in school. I didn't go, I got lucky. I never got arrested before I was an adult. That didn't come till later. But I would say it escalated in, in my, I lost control when I thought I had control. Technically, my life had just become unmanageable, you know, not going to school, not having any adults, you know, any positive role models and listening to all the wrong people led me down some, some pretty dark roads and got myself in some pretty bad situations because of it, you know, sexual abuse, things like that. And it just knocked me even lower to where at that point I didn't, I did not see a way out of it. I did not have any self-worth, any, any care for myself. So at that point I was just a wrecking ball on full speed. Yeah, it went from feeling like I had a little bit of control in my life to, to drugs controlling every aspect of my life. At that point, it didn't, I, the money didn't even matter anymore. It became making money to feed my habits, you know, making money just to, just to get a meal. The money didn't even matter anymore. It was how high can I possibly get to avoid everything that I have created in my life or tried to overcome in my life. It was just chaos. What really made the difference in me wanting to do better for myself and believe in myself, in 2017, it really changed my whole dynamic. In 2017, I had gotten released from jail in October. I was on probation. My mother was allowing me to stay in her house on and off kind of. She didn't want me there, but I was doing good and I was on probation and she didn't want me to go back to jail. But I had both of my kids with me. It was January 24th, 2017. We were at my mother's house and one morning my, my mother literally just woke up and decided that she was going to try to kill her whole family. So I was sitting on the couch with my kids. It was about 10 o'clock in the morning. My mother hadn't gotten up yet, which was unusual. I got up to go check on her. I went back to her bedroom and she was sitting on the edge of her bed and she didn't look good. And I was like, Mom, are you okay? And she was like, no, I don't feel good. And I was like, okay, get some rest. I walked back out to sit with my children on the couch. We had all just woke up. We were watching cartoons about to eat breakfast and my mom comes slowly walking out of her room, walks, walks back to my brother Devin's room. He doesn't say anything. Just walks by, comes back out into the living room, looks at me and the blink of an eye was on top of me. And I remember just reaching up and grabbing her arms and I was like, Mom, what are you doing? And I looked down and I have a knife sticking through my chest straight down into my chest. And I remember just being so confused in that moment because nothing had happened. And then proceeded to get her off of me and she threw me on the ground and I'm on the ground and all of a sudden I'm weak. My mom's got a knife sticking over my face and I'm fighting with all of my life, screaming for help, screaming for my brother to come help me. My children are sitting on the couch watching this entire thing covered in blood. And so I'm sitting there trying to fight my mom off of me. I've already been stabbed. I have a knife directly over my eyes and she's smiling in my face. I'm screaming for my brother, Devin, come help me. Devin, come help me. And she just looks over and gets off of me and runs after him into his bedroom. Going in and out of consciousness. I get up. I run to my brother's room. He's 19 years old. He's a guy I'm thinking. I'm looking at him. I'm looking at her. I'm like, he can fight her off. I look down. I see my children. Like I said, I'm in and out of consciousness. I had to make a decision. Like I can't help him, but I can help all of us by finding somebody else to who I can call. And get my kids away from this. So I run outside and I'm just screaming help. I see my kids standing at the door thinking they're going to follow me out the house. I collapse in the road completely. I'm out of consciousness at this point. I found out that my children didn't come all the way outside and follow me outside. They turned around and went back in there not knowing what to do as kids. They seen their mom collapse in a road and they watched my 19 year old brother get murdered and stabbed to death by my mother and then stab herself trying to do murder suicide. I was rushed to the hospital. My kids were put in, they were put in like a temporary foster care. I was stabbed straight through my heart and into my lung. I had open heart surgery. Two of my arteries are tied off. It hit two of my arteries. The upper quadrant of my heart does not receive circulation, but I'm okay. I'm fine. But I lost my brother that day and I couldn't understand. My brother was an amazing kid. My brother was a perfect kid. He never got in trouble. He never struggled with drugs. He never struggled with drinking. He graduated high school, had a job, was the kindest soul you could ever meet. And I could not understand why I survived that as an addict, but this perfect soul, this beautiful soul got taken that day. And through that, my kids were also taken from me too. I lost custody with this incident. And then, you know, I did good for a little while after, I want to say maybe a month or two. And I just felt so deep in my addiction more so than ever. At that point, it was just like I didn't want to be there. I had no idea how to cope, how to be a person, how to allow somebody else to love me, how to love anybody else. You know, I lost my brother. My kids were ripped away from me. Everything I had ever known was just gone at that point. And that I went to prison from there, from that part of my addiction. So that's what really changed it. Whenever I was in prison, I was like, you know what, no, I didn't, I didn't live for nothing. You know, even though I don't just feel like I deserve to be here because of who I was before. I lived for something and I can live for my kids too. So my addiction lasted from the age of 12, 13 years old to 26. Whenever I was 26, that's when I changed, I decided to change my life. I had gone to prison, I got out of prison and I was just, I wanted something different, you know, trying to stay high in order to escape everything. And you think you have this false sense of healing and you're just, you're reaching for healing and you're reaching for healing, but you're never able to grasp it because all you're doing is destroying yourself. I wanted that healing in my life. I wanted to overcome the traumas in my life that I had never given myself a chance to face. It wasn't until I decided to change and to do something different that I realized that's when the healing began. Like that's when I could actually overcome all the things that I had gone through. I made that decision, but I made that decision and I also had no support. Like I had nobody to back me up with those decisions that I was making, but I just, I seen something in myself that never gave up through everything that I faced, everything that I went through. I didn't give up on myself through all of that. I didn't love myself. I didn't have self-worth, but I noticed I didn't never give up and that was for a reason. So making those decisions, like I just decided whatever it was going to take, wherever it was going to lead me, even if it wasn't everything that I was wanting, I felt like I was worth at least giving myself a shot. So I got out and I had nowhere to go. I actually went right back into my addiction the first two weeks I was out of prison, but it was different this time. This time it didn't feel like an escape. It felt completely wrong. Like this is, I told myself when I was in prison, like we're going to get out and we're going to do it all different. And it felt different when I said it then. And when I got out and went right back to it, it felt different then as well. Like it wasn't for me anymore. And I struggled. I was bouncing. I was couch surfing, bouncing around from this person's house to that person's house. They were all using an active addiction. And I ended up at one of my friend's house who was doing a lot better in her life, you know, in her addiction recovery. And I told her everything that was going on. And I was like, you know, I messed up, but this doesn't feel like me anymore. And she herself was just like, you know what? I believe you and I want to see where you can go in your life. And her and her husband actually allowed me to stay with them for a month or two. And then I met a friend who traveled working in the pipe field and they had seen how well I was doing. And they were like, you know what? Come with me. I'll help you get a job. So I just leapt. I was like, this is it. This is the opportunity that I've been waiting for. I'm nervous. I don't know where this is going to lead, but I'm going to go for it. So I started traveling on the road. I was a pipe fitter helper and an expediter and that's all I needed. I just needed somebody to believe in me for the first time in my life. I needed opportunity and I needed to believe in myself and it made all the difference. How do you get to know? They are the most resilient people I have ever seen in my life. They were three and four at the time of this. Now they're 13, 14. And I have not seen them skip a beat. They are amazing. They're thriving. They're both so smart. They make straight A's sometimes in school. If not A's, A's and B's, they're excelling in their lives. And I admire them so much. They're beautiful. They're great. How do you get to know? Now, oh, you know, I never thought I'd see this side of life. I always thought, you know, getting sober and overcoming what I did, I thought my life would be okay. I thought it would be like mediocre, but God had other plans for me. I'm actually a board member and a case manager of an organization called Offensive, where I get to give back to people struggling like I once was. It's beautiful. I get to work closely with other organizations in my town. Jailers Boys, they're amazing. You know, if it weren't for them, you know, posting about this event right here, I wouldn't have even thought to come and tell my story. But I've got to see the amazing work that they do in the community. You know, I've been able to turn something so terrible in my life, all the family trauma, the dysfunction, the addiction. I've been able to turn it around to do good to help other people who are struggling and just be a beacon of hope. Offensive helps a lot of women. They help a lot of men as well. But I personally work alongside with the women. A lot of the women we work with, you know, have been in severe abusive relationships, family, you know, domestic, have been sexually trafficked, you know, lost in their own addictions and things like that. And so it's been a blessing for me myself to be able to give these women a little bit of hope in their lives and to see them overcome their barriers and achieve their goals. And it shows how resilient we can really be. I never thought I'd be on the other side of this. In my life, I was sure that I was going to die in addiction. I was sure that that's the only person that I could be. I never believed that I could be somebody giving back to somebody else. Like, you see these people with these badges and your addiction, and those are the people you're going to for help, and it's... You don't look at them and say, oh, well, I can do that. But now I am doing that. I am that person with the badge now. I am that person that can help somebody else. When first so long, that wasn't an option for me. I had fully convinced myself that. Because when you have the life experience, you're able to reach these people in a way, say somebody who just goes to school and they're learning from a book. You can learn about it all day long, but until you've lived it, you have no idea what that person is actually facing mentally and the challenges that they are facing in themselves and how can you combat the issue without fully understanding what it looks like to that person. So having the life experience, and I've had so many women tell me, we'll come to you and we'll talk to you because you know us. You've been us. You understand how I actually feel and what I'm actually going through. And with that, that's where lasting change happens. That's where real relation happens. That's when they actually have hope. Because you're not just a person with a book in front of them. You've been there, you've done that, and you've overcome it. So maybe they can too. Thank you.

llT2tFIAfBs,"I'm a father of two sons. I don't know, anything else. Used to be a piece of shit. Working on that day. Sorry, I came out of the gate swinging on that one. I've known for a long time that I was an alcoholic and a drug addict, and actually the drug addict is a drug addict. I've been a drug addict for a long time. I've been a drug addict for a long time. I've been a drug addict for a long time. I've been a drug addict for a long time. I've been a drug addict for a long time. I was an alcoholic and a drug addict, and actually the drug addict part didn't really kick in until I got older, but I knew that I was different and, you know, just the way I felt inside, the way I interacted with people and stuff like that. I'd known for a long time that I was a definite alcoholic. It gave me the freedom to be kind of who I wanted to be at a younger age. Then as I got older it progressed into who I didn't want to be. So my addiction, it progressed all the way in my 20s, and then my sons now are 22 and 18, and so the time they were growing up, I would just drink on weekends and at the evening, typical evenings and stuff like that, and then it just, it really, it got worse. And, you know, I'd always wanted to be a good father, somebody that they could look up to because I didn't have that as a child growing up. And, you know, and I always wanted that, but then after a while I saw the alcohol started taking it away from me, and I started isolating a lot at my shop at night. It really brought me into a state of depression, shame, guilt. I did a lot of bad things that, you know, in my addiction that I'm still not proud of, you know, and I'm still working on that forgiveness of myself right now. But I got to a point of such desperation. I remember I would sit there at night when I was drinking and using and I'd just look up and I'd be like, God, when are you going to help me become the person that I want to be? Because I'd had this vision in my head for a long time of the kind of person I wanted to be, you know, a successful business owner, a successful father, husband, all these things that I wanted to be in life, but the alcohol and drugs didn't allow me, well, I didn't allow myself to do it. I let the drugs now call me an excuse for me to not become the person that I wanted to be, but then after a while I couldn't stop. You know, there was a point in time where I could stop for a couple weeks and then, you know, I tried AA for about eight or nine, maybe almost 10 years, and I'd go to AA meetings and it wasn't for me. I mean, the AA meetings, I'd walk into a group and I'd be like, not me, not me, definitely not me, I'm sure I'm gonna fucking do what that guy did, and then I'd be like, man, this and that. And so, you know, I'd go six months without drinking a drug. Well, okay, I'd go six months without drinking, but I did the marijuana maintenance program. I did other things and, you know, I just smoke weed and stuff and not drink, but in 2015 I was in a motorcycle wreck. I'd been sober for nine days and I had one of those days where I was just fucked. I was just, I was a mess and she's my ex-wife. Now she's like, you should probably go to a meeting tonight. And so I got on my Harley and cleaned it all up and threw my headphones in, my helmet, and I was heading to a meeting and I got about three to five minutes away from our house. And I live in Grapevine and I was driving down the road and a car pulled out in front of me and my T-boned it right in the side and I remember landing on the ground and this lady was standing there and she's like, are you okay? Are you okay? And I'm like, yeah. And she's like, what hurts? What hurts? And I'm like, my fucking ass. And because I felt like my back was, was broken. She's like, what about your shoulder? My shoulder was hanging like six, eight inches out of the socket and, and so ambulance comes, my ex-wife come and they're, they're on the street. My kids are looking at me and they're loading me into the ambulance and I get to the hospital and I remember it took them three times to put my shoulder back into socket. They would take, they would try to put it in. It wouldn't go in and they'd put morphine and then bring me Dilaudid and morphine and Dilaudid. And all these drugs that they were putting in me and I, and I'd left the hospital. And it was crazy. I remember waking up after each time the doctor tried to set it in there and I'd look over at my kids and the faces on there, the look on their faces. They were just like, what in the fuck is he doing? You know, cause I was just like, I was kind of out of it. I was high as a kite and, and I left the hospital and they gave me a prescription of OxyContin. And it was supposed to last two weeks and I did the whole prescription in about four days because it said add as needed and I'm terrible with instructions and it says as needed. I was in constant pain and so depleted the prescription and then it just, it led to more and kind of to go back on the story a little bit. My mom to this day is still a full blown addict and she's in active addiction and my whole life growing up, I saw her taking pain pills and it, and it devastated me and it, and it's affected our relationship big time. And it just saddens me that she's still in that addiction. But I told myself I'm never going to get addicted to pills. Fuck, I left that hospital. Addicted to, God damn it, addicted to pain meds. I didn't know it at first and it took, and it took a while, you know, because it was, it was a long process. I'd ended up breaking my shoulder in two places, dislocating it and I had surgery like two weeks later and they had to put like 20 plastic screws in there. You know, and it was, it was one of those things where it's kind of funny. They did the MRI on this shoulder and so they thought it was just a slight tear. And when they went in here, they're like, nothing's wrong with it. And so they looked at this one and it was completely destroyed. And so this, it was going to be like an hour and a half surgeon ended up being almost eight hour surgery. And so I came out and I was on a morphine drip and, and all these things. And then the pain pills came in and, and I told myself that I'm, I'm not going to drink anymore because I was actually headed to an AA meeting when I got in my motorcycle wreck. And when I started coming to, I started getting the feeling from the pain pills and it made me feel good. And I didn't need the alcohol anymore. So I went two years without drinking and I was only on pain pills. But those two years of being on those pain pills, I had, then I got on Adderall and then I got on Xanax. I found a new meaning to life and it was in the form of a pill and it completely changed my life. It completely spiraled it. And then after about two years, I started drinking casually because I figured I could handle it again. And then cocaine got involved. And then I started smoking cocaine, which is crack. And it just, I spiraled out of control so fast to where I didn't want to live anymore. I mean, I just, I remember a couple of weeks before I'd gone to treatment that I remember looking up in my office, in my shop, and I was just out there and I was like, just take me. I'm done. I don't even want to live anymore. I just, I want to be out of here. And I said, you know, if you, if you did exist, why in the fuck can't you help me get better? About two weeks later, I had, it was on Super Bowl Sunday. Actually, we had, we usually had a big Super Bowl party and my ex-wife, she's, she said, we're not going to have a Super Bowl party this year. And I'm like, why is yours? Something's off with you. You're, well, I've been smoking crack every day for about a month. And she didn't have any idea. And so we talked that night and, and she said, you know, what, what is going on with you? Did you, did you, you started the pills again? Because I'd, I'd quit the pills about a month ago, but then my addiction to cocaine and I was, I was smashing up my Adderall, I was smashing up my Vicodin, I was smashing up all my pills. I was snorting them. Then I was smoking crack. I was snorting cocaine. I mean, I was anything and everything I could put in my body to just not feel anything. And I remember telling my ex-wife at the time that I was smoking crack and the look on her face was of complete shock. You know, it's, it's sometimes embarrassing to say, you know, but I'm not embarrassed of it anymore because it's who I am today. And I wouldn't be sitting here today if I, if I didn't admit my faults and go through it. But I remember sitting there and looking at the look on her face and she couldn't believe it. And she's like, we'll get through this. And I said, okay. And so the next morning I got up and we were supposed to have this talk and everything. And I went straight to the trap house and got more drugs and started using that next morning. And my friend called me that night. Well, she had called him and told him that I was still using and he asked me, he said, what are you doing? I said, and it is about two o'clock in the afternoon. I said, I'm getting high smoking crack and drinking. And he said, all right. He says, well, he says, why don't you do me a favor? I said, all right, what's that? And he goes, why don't you try to overdose on smoking crack tonight? So I want you to just get as fucked up as you can and have as much fun as you can tonight. And I said, okay, perfect. And I said, why tonight? And he goes, because you're going to go to go to treatment tomorrow. And I said, okay. And inside of me, I was so excited and I was so relieved, but I didn't know why. And so I went out and I got as high as I could. I'd spent like $1,200 at night on crack and other things and, you know, drugs and everything. And I'd used all night. And the next morning I called him and he said, call Wright Stupper Valley Hope. And so I called Valley Hope to treatment center in Grapevine to see if they have a bed for you. And I said, okay. And I called him that morning and I was hoping they didn't have a bed. I wasn't finished yet. And I called and I called the front desk and told him my name and they said, okay. And I asked if they had a bed and they said we do. And inside I was like, fuck, that sucks. And then the other part of me was like, all right, let's go. Let's do this. And so I packed a bag. My buddy Daniel came over, picked me up at the house at 6.30 that morning. I was out in the garage getting high and drinking and I'll never forget. I'd walked into the house and I dropped a beer can in the garage and I turned around and both my sons had walked down the stairs. And they're both looking at me and the amount of shame and guilt that I still hold to this day. I hope never goes away because I don't ever want to forget that moment of the look of disappointment in their face. Because checking in to Valley Hope was probably one of the hardest things I've ever done in my life. Because I thought only losers went to treatment. I thought only losers had to get help that we had this thing called self-will that I could get myself out of this. And not going to Valley Hope and not getting the help you need. That's for, in my opinion, that's for, I don't want to say losers because nobody's a loser in this thing, man. I mean, it's addictions a motherfucker and it doesn't discriminate to who you are, what you are. Some people can go in and get the help and other people can't. It's just, it's frustrating when you, anyway, look into that. So going into Valley Hope, I remember walking in and being so disgusted with myself and the lady checking me in. And so my buddy Daniel that brought me into treatment, I had taken him to a treatment center 10 years prior. And him, he's willing to drive it into the circular driveway at Valley Hope. And he said, I was here 10 years and two weeks ago. And now I'm dropping you off here. And I was like, wow, that's pretty cool. And so I go in and I get checked in and remember the lady I was walking down. I said, well, I guess this is my walk to shame. And she goes, no, this is your new walk. This is going to be your walk of your new life. And I remember turning around looking at her, I says, we'll see about that. And that was February 7th of 2018. And it's been the coolest ride that I've ever been on. I still go up to Valley Hope about four or five days every week. I take meetings in there on Mondays. This part I get emotional because I get to do these things now. I love being able to be a part of Valley Hope. I take meetings in there on Mondays and Wednesdays. We have a meeting in the cafeteria. And then on Tuesdays and Fridays, we get to go in and speak to the patients about addiction, about trying to help them, and then we'll get sponsors and we'll be able to work with them. And it's just such a cool process, man. I mean, it's anybody going through addiction that has any amount of time knows that it is a roller coaster. It's a, you go through depressions, you go through anxiety, you go through fear, all these different emotions that one can go on on a daily basis. It's pretty incredible. But the coolest part is being able to do this sober now. My way of fixing any problem that I had before was getting drunk or high. And that's how I would fix everything. And now being able to use it with the program, especially with sharing my experience, strength and hope with others inside Valley Hope, it allows me the, I don't want to say freedom, but it allows me the opportunity to go in and share my experience with other alcoholics and other drug addicts, give them some hope and give them some faith that this program does work, because I use the 12 steps of the AA program and it has 100% worked for me. I do a little bit of work on it every day versus getting higher drunk every day that I used to do for anywhere from 16 to 18 hours a day. And now I do about three or four hours. If that with a meeting every day and it's completely saved my life, changed my life, everything that addiction took from me, I'm regaining it back now tenfold. And it's just, it's an incredible way to live. And I just, I appreciate every experience and every opportunity that comes at me now with open arms. I mean, some of the things that I'm being a part of now is just, it's incredible. And I'd never been able to do this if I was still drinking or using. I mean, being, being clean and sober and having a clean mind and giving back and helping is 100% to me where it's at. In my addiction, if, if, if I wanted something, I needed something in return. You were going to give me something back if I helped you. There was no question that I was not doing anything unless I was getting something out of it in return. Now I don't want anything. The only thing I want is to help and I just want to help the other people because that's what was given to me, especially when I went to Valley Hope, the staff, the counselors, the nurses, the kitchen staff, everybody there just gave so free and willingly and they still do. I mean, I still talk to a lot of people that I've had opportunity to work with when I was there. They're still there and they're still given and they're still doing the same thing. And I love each and every one of them and it's just, it's a cool process, man. And addiction sucks. I've done every, every drug. I've smoked and snorted everything other. The only thing I didn't do was put a needle in my arm. Thank God. You know, it's definitely, in fact, I was just talking to a guy the other day and I said, you know what? I said, it's crazy. I said, I don't even remember what a hangover feels like anymore. I said, I remember the pain of what it felt like to be an addiction feels like because I hope I never forget that. But having that feeling of being sick in the morning, I just, I forget what that's like and I don't ever want to feel it again because, you know, in addiction, I 100% believe that diet and exercise is so important. And so, you know, I get up, I go to the gym, not every morning. I try to go as often as I can. But it's, it is, it's, it's like you said, Glenn, I wake up with a purpose now. And my purpose now is not to get fucked up. It's, it's how I can be just a little bit better of a person every day and to help other people and just strive to be a little bit better. You know, before I just always wanted, I wished that I could be better, but I'd always fucking take two or three steps back because I was either getting high. Or drunk and then feeling sorry for myself and ashamed of my decisions and guilt and blah, blah, blah. Now it's like I wake up and I'm driven to do just a little bit better every day. And it's like, if there's now, if there's a downtime or something, I don't get as much done. I don't beat myself up as much because I'm like, all right, you know what, just get after it now instead of making excuses and, you know, and sitting in my head and, you know, forming a committee inside my head and fighting against myself and shit all day because I used to do that for hours. I did it in, in my sobriety for the first couple of years that I would, I would fight my demons inside my head of not wanting to do this, not wanting to do this. And, and I, and I think that is probably one of the coolest things now is just being able to get up freely. And it's a new freedom, man. I mean, it's like it's a, it's a different way to live. And it just, it feels good to have a fucking purpose in life to wake up in the morning and be like, all right, let's fucking get busy. Let's, let's do some shit. Let's help some people. Let's help some people. I mean, my business has gotten better. We started a second business. My fucking kids love the shit out of me now. They're like, man, this, this dad's cool as hell, man. You know, I'm like, I talked to my kids like I talked to you and they, they call me, I got one son. He's 22. He's almost got his pilot's license and he's doing it all himself. He's doing the schooling. He's gotten his own loan to get hit through his flight classes now. My youngest one just graduated high school and he's taken up golf. He just shot a 77 yesterday at 18 years old. And I'm like, I've never shot that low in my life. But, you know, the thing that's crazy is I, I, I recognize now that my youngest son is exactly like me, but completely different than me. And I'm so proud of him because he's 18 years old and he's never had a drop of alcohol. He's never had any nicotine. He's never had any drugs and he doesn't want any. And that's what he says his goal is like, I bought him an 18 year old, an 18 year sobriety chip for his birthday because he wanted one. He's like, dad, I got more sobriety than you do. So fuck, you know, I was like, awesome. You know, it's just cool to look and be able to look back now and see that because when I went to treatment, when I was in my worst addiction, I thought I'd completely screwed up my life. I thought I completely screwed up my relationship with my kids and it's better than, than it's ever been. And it's only going to get better and better. And, and I don't know, I'm so fucking thankful and grateful for recovery and being and given the second chance, the opportunity to, to become the person that I want to be because I'm just getting started with it too, man. I mean, this is, that's, that's what's so kickass about getting another opportunity to just start a new life is now I can take it as high as I want. You know, before I had limitations because my limitations were cut at the knees every morning I woke up now they're now they're just, I'm just watering the grass every day, man. And just feeding the shit and let's get busy. And so it's, and I appreciate this opportunity to sit here in front of you to, to be able to, because I just fuck more than everything, more than anything, man. I wake up my main purpose in the morning is to find just help one person that day. And that's it. You know, and if it's more than one, then that's, that's a blessing in itself, but just one person. And, and, and that's including myself too. I want to help myself every day just a little bit more than because then it just, it just gets better and better.

LlWujC2ZYh0,"I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it. Fetin' All has impacted my whole life, basically, because I've dealt with it myself and I've lost many people to it. I recently just started to, my journey of recovery, I'd say. I've never really took the full initiative or tried to start my recovery because it's been a really, really hard thing for me, but I've always told myself that once I finally do it, I get past the worst stages, which is the body aching, the withdrawing, the mental state, all of that. I'm never going back to it. Never again. It's just like you feel like you're dying, your whole body hurts, it feels like your guts are being ripped out of you and it's horrible. Anything you could think of, it's worse. It's pretty much behind me. It's more of a mental thing now. It's kind of challenging, but not as hard as I thought it would be. But it was pretty horrible having to go through the withdrawals. A lot of people don't realize that one of the main reasons people keep doing the drug is because it just hooks you on there and the hardest thing to do is to quit. For a little over two years, none of my family really knows that because I actually got clean one time before I got pregnant with my son is when I started using the first time I ever tried it. My cousin told me that it was like a Xanax because I was trying the perks, the Perk 30s and I was told by him and another person that it was just like a Xanax and that it wouldn't do nothing to me and I literally never stopped after that. I couldn't. I got hooked right away. In two hours after trying it the first time, I already started feeling like I could feel a difference in myself, you know, like the cravings. It's crazy. The minute I found out I was pregnant, I put down, I was smoking marijuana and I vaped cigarettes, tobacco, all of it. The withdrawals had on, like done. The minute that I found out, I stopped everything. It was pretty hard, but like I said, it's more of a mental thing if you think about it because for me, I wasn't doing it for myself. I was doing it for this like little life that I created that it was my fault that it was happening. You know, like kids don't choose to be born. Like you are no one the same mistakes, but like from your parents, past or whatever. Right. Not planned. So I put it as like this is my fault and I'm going to deal with it and I'm not going to do the same thing to my kid that happened to me. Like I grew up around everybody using not fit and all, but because obviously it wasn't like that. But like any memories I can think of when I was little, like it all makes sense when I get older. Why certain aunts and uncles were acting certain ways. Like my life was full of addiction. Everyone around me. Like it's all I ever knew. So I didn't want that for my son. So I decided to like do it for him instead of myself, which everyone's all like, you need to do it for you or you're not doing it right at all. But I feel like that's not, you have to have something that like makes you want to do it. You know, like do right. And my son is out for me and him having a good mother, a good role model because his father passed away from fentanyl, actually. So I wanted to show him like that he still had someone that he could look up to. Even if I'm like, did all that stuff and like messed my life up that you could still do better, no matter what. My baby daddy and me moved out to Topeka while we were going to Kansas City on the weekends and leaving my son with my dad. And we started using again, but it was like, well, this is what we said to make ourselves feel better about it. I feel like it was our weekend drug, but it's not just like a weekend drug. It'll like you don't notice it. Like I didn't notice until now, like it was slowly taking over my life. I started wanting to go to Kansas City more and like leaving my son with my mom and my dad because I would rather him in that environment, you know, then traveling back down the path that I like tried so hard to get myself away from. But it is what it is. I messed up. Me and my baby daddy started using again in about four months. My son was four months old. My baby daddy passed away from fentanyl. And I actually was the one that found him. I woke up and he was on the floor already gone. It was so messed up. I was, me and him were actually staying at his sister's apartment because she was away seeing her mom with her daughter. So she, when we came into town, she let us come stay at her apartment. And I didn't know the address. I banged on every apartment door in that complex and nobody answered. I was yelling saying I needed the cops to come. That my baby daddy was in the other room and I didn't know if he was alive or dead or not. And nobody answered. I had to run out, run across the street and then she, a neighbor answered and she asked if she told him the address. I gave her the phone. She did everything. She gave the cops the address. I explained to her what happened. She made it, wasn't easy, but she made it better, helped with it. And she asked me if I wanted her to come with me to see if she could check on my baby daddy because she was a nurse. And she could at least tell me if he was breathing or trying to help or something. Like she didn't just want to let me go back. And at the time, my little cousin, she's, she was 10 years old. She was also staying with us, but she was asleep in the living room. She didn't really know what was going on. I told her to stay out, not to go in the room. I came back and she was in the room with him. And she was crying and she was trying to like, trying to help him. So I had her come out and I let the lady go in and like as she comes out, I like hear the sirens. And she was like, you need to go say bye. They're not going to let you. And I was like, what? And she told me he was gone. And right as I walked in and I like got to say, like sat there with him, the ambulance came in. They didn't do nothing. They looked at him and they said he's been gone and there's no use in even trying. It's just going to hurt you more to give you false hope and whatever they thought, you know, to make them look better. They didn't try at all. Like they didn't do chest compressions. They didn't like nothing. They felt his pulse and put him in the bag. And the last time I saw him before the funeral was when they were carrying him out on the stretcher in the body pack. And by that time his mom was there, sister, his little brother. I had to tell them all that he was gone. For a few months I was clean. I found a pill in my car and threw it out the window. Like thinking of like thinking back to it now. I can't believe I did that. Like I was so like bad and stuck in my addiction that like I cannot believe that I even had an end need to get rid of it. But I did and I stayed clean for about three and a half months because after his third month at the grave, at his grave site that we threw it, everybody went home to my uncles and we were all drinking, you know, being sad, crying it out. And I went to my older sister and she was in one of, leading on to the worst parts of her addiction. And I relapsed with her and I didn't tell nobody. I didn't even tell her. I lied to her and I told her that I was sick because I've been doing it and I needed some because I knew that she wouldn't just give it to me and be the cause of my relapse. Because no matter what, like even in her worst part of addiction, she didn't want to break me down with her. And that day, like it was just like a spiral from there. I did that. I then I went and I got real perk fives and I did like four of them. Then it from that on, it was like, it was just straight, like going straight head on in it. So I just gave up. I was like, there's no hope. The cycle, there's not no breaking the cycle. Like, so I just threw myself into numbing the pain by using drugs, like everybody else. My past is not something I'm ashamed of, I'll say, but like it's definitely not something I'm very proud of. My first time even dabbling with drugs, it's way before that, way before fentanyl was even a thing. I was like 12 years old, smoking and selling weed. It was a long coming for me. I did what I knew, what I was around, what I grew up from, what I heard of. I'm not dumb. I know who my dad was, the person he used to be. And people talk about street cred and stuff like that. And my dad had a lot of it. But he used that as an example of exactly what he didn't want us to be, but I kind of like took it in the wrong way. And I learned from his mistakes, not really, he doesn't even know it. He's probably gonna be like, what the f*** when he sees this. But I actually got a respect for myself and like from his past accomplishments. I was very known, I'm very known in the not so good part of Kansas City, Kansas. It's not something I'm proud of. I've got a couple like stupid things that I wish would have never done, like all the like gang tattoos and riding in solos and stealing stuff and stuff like that bad. Like, but it's something that I put behind me that I like to like, I like to think of it and look back at it as something that I never want to do again. Like I never want to bring myself back down to that level that I was on. Because even though I'm only exact, like to be honest, I'm only like 13 days clean. But I feel like I took the initiative and I took that step myself. So I'm just, I'm going to keep building myself up. And I know like, I know that I can be better than the person I was. It's just going to take time. But like to this, like to this day now, I still have people still trying to contact me and drag me back to where I was. But I just look at it as something like, that's exactly what I don't want to do. That like people messaging me, trying to act like they care, act like they want better for me. But at the same time, they're the exact same people that were dragging me down and making like, glorifying my actions. Say, oh, it's okay. You deserve to feel that way and act that way. You just lost your baby daddy, your and your sister all in two years. You should be able to do what you want. No. People should not like, I feel like the worst thing people do is make it okay for people who just lost someone to like, to do worse to keep like, it's okay. She just lost her sister, sister, let her go, let her go do drugs and up and probably be the next one. Like, I feel like that's such the light. That's so dumb. And that's exactly what everyone does. It feels good to be alive. Like, and not have to constantly think of the next high, making sure that you're not going to be sick and withdrawing. Yes, you got to go through it. But the best feeling ever is being able to say that even though I'm newly into it, that you got past addiction and that you're trying. And it just like, it just feels so much better. Like everything about it. You wake up, yeah, you can got a shit going on your life. It's not good. There's things to be sad about, but it's also at least you're alive and you know you're not risking your life. Like you tomorrow's promise. Now, a few weeks ago, tomorrow wasn't promised for me. And it feels good to know like that I did that and that I achieved that. Something that I never thought. I never really thought like, I don't know if I would thought I was just going to die or just like be a drug addict my whole life. But I didn't think about how it was going to end. And I feel like that's the problem with a lot of people is they don't think about how it's going to end for them, you know. I'd like to help other people. Like my dad brought it up being, I don't know what it's called a drug counselor or something like that. It's just easier to help other people when you have personally been through what they've been through and can understand on like a different level because that's one of the reasons I really never looked or reached out for help is because I always felt like you've never been in my shoes. You haven't been through what I've been through and you haven't felt what I felt. So you're not going to be able to help you. And when you have your own story to share like yourself, but there's a turn, there's a happy ending to it. Like you get to tell them that like you got out of it, you fought your addiction and won. Like you beat it and it is like it's possible because a lot like I never, never thought that like I'd say, you know, like I want to get clean or I'm going to stop. I'm going to stop doing drugs by next week or I'm not going to do it no more. But like in reality, I didn't really think that I said it to make other people happy, to make my family happier and like hopes of that they believe me. But I was just lying to myself. If you can't find it in yourself to want to change and do better for yourself, do it for the people that love you because it affects them so much more than you'll ever know. It affects them more than it affects you because you're just hiding your grief and your sadness and whatever you're dealing with. You're just covering it and doing drugs using like using the drugs to push it to the side of everybody else doesn't have that to make them feel better. When I was in addiction, I didn't care really like I say like, yeah, I cared how people looked at me. But I would be like, I don't care how they feel. That's not that's them. That's that ain't me. And that's not my problem. Me, I would have, I would have never done that to my family. Like if I could go back in time, I know a lot of people say this, I would and like I would change so much. But I can't. So that's why I'm changing now and doing better now. Yeah, I'd like to be doing better, but I'm doing all right. Pretty good to what I was because if you would have seen me a few weeks ago, you probably would have been like, what the f*** get this crack out of here? Because like through my addiction from fit and on, it also led me to a lot of other stuff and opened up a lot of other bad like doorways for me. I tried a lot of different things. Like I didn't only get addicted to fit and all I got it, oh, it just sparked my addiction for drugs period. Just anything to numb the pain. But like I said, you're only numbing your pain. You're not, you got to care about the people around you. When I first started doing it, the dirty thirties, that's what they call them. They were more, they were more common. Like everybody, everybody was doing them. Like you'd be surprised. People like those, those one honor roll students, cheerleaders, you'd never think they'd do anything bad in their life and they're so perfect and wouldn't even smoke weed. They're all doing it. Everybody, it's like, you are what you're surrounded by. Like I said, you want to impress other people. You want to make yourself look cooler. So you're just going to try shit without even thinking about it. Like, and after that, I did the pills for about a year and a half. But then it wasn't enough for me. I wasn't getting high no more. It was taking the withdraws away, but I wasn't, I wasn't really doing it for that. I wasn't doing it to get high, to not have to think about anything, to just like be there, but basically gone. Not there. And I started doing striped fentanyl, which comes in how they call it powder or it comes in like rock, like kind of like crystals, but not really like a powdery crystal. And that's how I started doing it. And that's what brought the worst down to me. Like it was horrible. That's when I knew like I'm an addict. I am and that I was, I had a problem. And I did in the worst part was like, I didn't care. I didn't care at all. Like it took me losing three people. But I'm finally realizing that like I got to stop and I got to do better. Because I do not want my dad to, he's almost lost his shit over my sister. He loses one more kid. He's going to lose his, he's crazy. He's losing this shit. My mom, she's holding, she holds herself together very, very good. Very good. Like she holds herself together for her and my dad. And I couldn't imagine making them go through that again. Like having my family feel the way that I felt like my little sisters, my little brother, like my big brother, losing another sibling. Because yes, like I lost my baby daddy. I lost my aunt, but that was my best friend. Like she was my everything. Me and her, like she was basically like my twin. We were only about a year and a half apart. So everything, we did everything together, matching clothes all the time. Since when we were toddlers, like everything. She's my best friend.",loaded_from_file,16595,FENTANYL: Loss and Recovery - Becca's Story,1317.0,29,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00
mh80qU9PPkw,"The road began probably when I was 11 years old. Of course, started smoking pot. About 13 I ended up breaking my foot in half and got put on pain pills. Real high dose pain pills. And after that when the doctors tried to take me off of them, I just kept taking them and kept taking them. When I was 14, the only reason that I got sober was because I had defended a friend and had gotten into altercation, gotten into some trouble, ended up getting locked up. But in there you can't do nothing so I had stayed sober for four years. Well, I guess I wasn't done. It was just an abstinence for four years. I got out on my 18th birthday. The only thing that kept me from getting messed up was to ride home. As soon as I got back to our neighborhood, I went right back to where I was hanging out. Family members, just stuff like that. It seemed like they were waiting there with open arms. It continued off and on, incarceration, rehabs, but every time I just didn't get it. November the 15th of 2021 was my first day completely sober and I've been sober ever since. I just decided that I wasn't going to get high no more and I kept my word. I've been sober for 26 months. I just celebrated the 15, 26 months. I can't guarantee nothing, but I know for today I'm not going to get high. I am in the recovery with a sober living community. I joined the Oxford House community 420 of 2022 and have lived in three houses, two of which I have went to restructure one because it was falling apart and it's successfully running right now. The second one, the third one, I had help open and it's been open since October and it's a prospering. Every person's got their own recovery program. Some people have to do the N.A. and the A.A. thing. Some people just, like I said, just don't want to do it no more. They just learned how to be adults again and you just got to strengthen your mind. Maybe it's for me, listening to other people's story that helped also that made me want to do better. Because I knew it could be done and maybe I heard somebody's story that I felt like that was me telling it up there. That's the only thing that seems to make sense to me whenever I think about it. And I must have heard somebody's story that I just felt like that was me. And what they did in the process of to get to where they are and I seem to be doing pretty good for myself right about there. It took me a couple of tries to figure it out, but I don't know. Like I said, this time it worked. That was the day after I got picked up. It was my first day sober because I did not get intoxicated or anything the whole time that I was incarcerated. And when I got out, I stayed sober. And I'm still sober to this day. I'm still accomplishing goals that I thought a couple of years ago before I got sober. I would never do. As in getting a job that pays 20 plus an hour. I got my daughter back in my life. Just driver's license, car, everything just falls in place when you're doing the right thing. You just got to keep going because it's not going to happen. You got to give up the instant gratification thing. Like when you were selling drugs or whatnot, that instant gratification is got to go out the window because anything that I have worked for has taken time. Subriety was right there at the beginning, but that's not all that it's about. You got to rebuild your life. Listen. Ask questions. There's so many things out there that can help you. And maybe like I said, it'll you'll just grasp onto something that just be your, your, you know, your cement. Stand on it and just keep building. You ain't going to build a house by imagining it. You're just going to build it by learning how to do it. That's just what works for me. And maybe it'll work for somebody else. That's the whole point of me telling it was going on. I've overdosed nine times. And by the grace of God, I'm still here. Fentanyl, heroin, opiates. I didn't met the amphetamines too, but my drug of choice was fentanyl, heroin, pills. The way I looked at it is fentanyl is cheaper than buying an oxycodone on the street. So if they press them into the pills and sucker somebody in the buying the pill, they're going to get more money out of it. They're mixing in with everything else. It doesn't even have to be pain pills, Xanax borers and all kinds of stuff. My life's back on track. I work. I'm able to pay my bills. It's just a different, I mean in the past I have been able to maintain, you know what I mean? But it was always a struggle. Now I don't have to struggle no more. I got my family back in my life to where like they trust me. To where they can call me and they know that if I say I'm going to do something, I'm there. I've got my daughter back in my life, which I was out of her life for multiple years in and out of incarceration, you know, in and out of drug use, stuff like that. And I was mad at the time that they kept her away from me because I still wanted to be in her life, but I understand why they did not. I've come to an understanding with my life that all the things they did weren't out of hate. It was out of love to make sure for her and for myself because I don't want to be in and out. But now I don't have to. I've come to learn that I'm completely at ease to know exactly why everything was done and to be able to face it, head on and hear why they didn't. And actually be able to understand. They tried to explain it before, but I wasn't trying to hear it. If you want it bad enough, you will go and get the help. That's when you're ready, you're ready. You'll know when you hear rock bottom, you know when it enough to move. And you'll take that step. You'll reach out, whether it's to somebody like myself that just has been through it and I can help you. Or you can figure it out on your own. I can steer you in the right direction, but I'm not going to do it for you. Because if I do it for you, that's just me enabling you to do whatever you want to do. It makes me look at things like to want to keep doing what I'm doing because it's... I know that I planted that seed. It might not grow right now, but it could grow in the future. And to know that it's there that when he's ready, he can do whatever he needs to do to get it done. Or she. I just hope that everybody takes some advice and if you're still out there doing what you're doing, it ain't worth it. There's avenues for every direction you want to go and I hope you guys take the right one.

mKd0BlxEdTw,"My name is Dene Jones. I'm here to tell my story of recovery. It is long and eventful and heartbreaking and exhilarating and I'm ready to tell it. So that's why I'm here. I've been sober now for two years. It took me like over a decade to get here. It was hard. There was a lot of denial, a lot of blaming it on other people, a lot of tries and fails for sure. It was definitely ten years of just being completely oblivious to the fact that my addiction solely came from me. It was solely my choice to abuse alcohol. I started drinking when I was 15. My mom was an alcoholic. She got sober when I was about six. Like my mom going to treatment is such a blur. I just remember it was like a movie. I was in the backseat of my grandmother's car and I was waving and I could just see them taking her away. I didn't really understand how important that moment was. But she did it. She went. She got sober. In her sobriety, she's become a trailblazer. She works with nonprofits. She introduced President Obama when he came here. She tells her story all the time. That's something I definitely want to do. When I started drinking, it was just fun. It was like party stuff. My mom always expected that most of me I went to a private school. If I didn't get an A, there was a problem. I always felt like I had the weight of the world a little bit on my shoulders. I was pretty hard on myself if I didn't do everything exactly right every time. Drinking was a way out of it. That's all I saw. Everybody just got a drink when they were stressed out or when they had a lot going on. It was just what you did to survive. I didn't think anything different when I started. At this time, I was born in Michigan but we moved to Ohio. My mom was a foreman for General Motors. I kind of relate to army kids. We just moved around a lot. Every time she went to a new plant, we would move. We lived in Michigan, Ohio, Alabama, and Texas. We moved around a lot. When we were in Ohio, we lived in this farm town. There was just acres of land. We had three acres. It was very isolating because there was no one or anyone from miles around. It was just me and her. It was just very isolating. When I did get a chance to get out and hang out with friends, I just wanted to take advantage of it as much as possible. I wanted to have as much fun as possible. To me, getting obliterated, that was definitely it. By the time I was like 18, graduated high school, that's what I was known for. Go to Denise's house. She's going to have a party. There's going to be all kind of alcohol. I was always super inventive with the stuff I made. I would make all these drinks. It wasn't just a keg. It was like a keg floating. It was just the most. But I took pride in it. People would wake up with people passed out in my apartment. I was so proud of that. I was like, oh man, I did great last night. Victory. Victory. Everybody is obliterated. I carried that like a badge of honor. If you want to have a good time, let me know. I got you. I was so proud to be able to say I can drink any man underneath the table. Try me, please. But at the end of the night, I was just nothing. I was absolutely nothing. I gave so much power away to people to tell me my worth. If I wasn't the most popular person in the room or the one everyone was looking for, I felt like I was doing something wrong because my worth was so tied up in how much people loved me and how much I loved myself. But I didn't realize that for many years. Lived in Alabama for a while, and then we moved to Texas. So I moved to Texas when I was 21, well I was 20. And coming from a very small town in Alabama to Houston, Texas was a game changer in all of the wrong ways. I was even scared to drive on the freeways for the first six months. I had never experienced anything this big. There was like five lanes. That was nuts to me. But once I started getting my bearings, I started getting to know people and making a group of friends that I really felt were good for me at that time. But again, like I said, I was 21. So my friends at the time were all younger than me. I was the one who was legal to buy alcohol, so that was my job. I bought all the alcohol. I went all to liquor stores. And I kept the party going as much as possible. But after a while, you know, the party caused a lot of problems. There was a day when I was, you know, Sunday brunch. You go out. It was a football season, so we were going to go watch the game. We went to brunch first. I always loved wine. I could finish a bottle of wine in one sitting. Seven days in Harris County. And that was the scariest thing that ever happened to me. I slept on the floor. There were no beds. They didn't have any more cots. They didn't care. They didn't care. I'd never experienced anything like that. My bond was so high, we didn't have that type of money. And I just remember my lawyer reading to me the police report while I was like behind that glass. And I was so ashamed. I couldn't believe it. I just couldn't believe it. I didn't remember it, but I also couldn't believe it. And I had to call my mom. And there was so much disappointment in her voice. And she answered the phone. It broke me. And my attorney told her, you have to sell everything. That's just replaceable. We got to get her out. I was suicidal. I remember I had a dress on that day and I had like a tie. And they asked me, are you okay with this tie? Are you going to hurt yourself? And I said, yeah. If you leave me alone long enough, I will. So then I was put on a suicide watch. That was terrible. And I remember when I got out, they let you out of just like this back street. I think everybody, if you've ever been to jail, you know where that is in Harris County. It's just this little building. And my mom was parked outside. And I felt like a zombie. Like walking to her car. I mean, I was so detached from reality. And I remember her telling me that she didn't even know who I was. Never seen me look like that. And she took me home. And as soon as I got home, I got in my car and I drove to the liquor store. And I bought two bottles of wine. And I came right back home. And I remember when I sat right in the middle of my living room, popped them open and just drank them and then passed out. Because I knew what I had done had forever changed my life. And it was no one's fault but mine. And then now I was going to be on probation. I was going to be drug test. Everything about my life was going to be monitored and watched. And so instead of thinking, okay, well, this is the time to probably get my shit together. Like this is real. You have a felony. What are you doing? I didn't do that. Instead I thought, okay, how can I get around this? And the best thing that came out of that was I was court ordered to go to therapy. And I met my first therapist. His name was Lucky. And he saved my life for sure. I'd never had somebody be so patient and kind with me. Because I had completely now given up on myself. I had no value. I was a felon. I was a drunk. I wasn't working. I had no money. And any money I did have went to the state. No one would hire me. I, I, I, there was, there was nothing inside of me anymore. I just was existing. And for at least three months, I would go to therapy and not say one word. I would just sit there and look at him. And he just looked at me and he would say, we're just going to keep doing this until you're ready. And finally one day I was ready. And that's when I learned about therapy and how powerful and helpful it is. What it means to have support, to have someone that says, it's okay, it's all right. It's totally fine. We're going to figure it out together, me and you. We're going to figure it out. And he did that for me. He was patient and he was kind. He fed me when I didn't have money. He took the time to really see who I was. And when I would talk down to myself, he would tell me that that's not who I was. And that was the first real step of change I believe that happened in my life. But I just couldn't fight the addiction. I couldn't stop. And then I lost a job. It was a really good job. I've always worked in mental health. I've always worked in psychiatry. I love helping people. I love learning about the mind. I decided to go back to school when I got out. I wanted to be a counselor. And while I was in school, it was like my rehab, right? I was just learning so much about the brain and why we do the things we do in addiction. And I was going to a psychiatrist trying to get my mental health together. And the psychiatrist told me I was bipolar. And I don't know why that hit me so hard. It was kind of like, this is, I work in this field for a living and I can't even recognize bipolar symptoms in myself. I do assessments. What, what's going on? And I felt like I didn't know myself. I was like, I don't know anything about me because I was just listening to what everyone's telling me about me. And if I didn't know me, why am I here? So I tried to drown myself in the pool in my apartment complex. I just walked right in there and just sat there at the bottom. But I called my mom before I did it, which is, you know, we know it was a sign that we didn't really want it to happen. And I think that I did because she came immediately and she dragged me out. And I just remember screaming at her, I need help. I need help. And that was the first time that I was put into like a mental health facility. And I'll never forget when I went to the hospital after trying to commit suicide, I was telling the nurse, I need to go like into recovery. I need, I need treatment. I need something. And she said, well, your insurance isn't that good. You know, there's not going to be many places that are going to be able to have you. And I was like, I don't fucking care. Someone has to help me. Someone has to help me. I'm not leaving. And I spent two weeks and it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I was around other people that went through what I went through, other women. And that was a feeling I never had. I never was around other supportive people who felt what I felt or who knew what I was going through. And they were right in front of me and they were patting me on the back and telling me that I could do it. And I felt like a million bucks. I was like, oh, I've got this now. I'm good. I was sober for maybe like six months after that. I was healthy. I was working out. I was exercising. I was getting all my classes. There was like this joy that came back to my life. I was just so happy to still be here. I was so blessed to still be alive. I was so happy. And then it's like depression, you know, it comes in waves, you know, some minutes you're way up and then you'll be back down. And I don't know if it was just life in general, you know, because with abuse, I mean substance abuse every day is not guaranteed, right? We're just trying to make it the next 24. And something, just a mix of life and jobs. I just said, fuck it. I need a drink. What's the worst? I don't have to tell anybody. This is when I got through like the, I'll keep it a secret, you know, no one has to know this is just me and my addiction. I can die or do it however I want to do it. It's mine. It's my life. I can't fucking fuck what they think. And I'm not going to tell them either. And so that's when I started hiding alcohol and thinking that no one knew, which I knew I was showing up smelling horrible, glazed eyes glazed over, just denying it, embarrassing myself. I mean I was at a, I was pretty low at that point because I had experienced sobriety. I knew how great it was, but I realized I couldn't get to it. Not on my own. I would have to sit on my hands. I would try to not leave and go drink. I didn't have a car at this time. So I would just walk. I would just get up and walk straight to the liquor store, work to the gas station anywhere I could. And so I remember having to like literally sit on my hands and just say, God, please, please, please, please, please. It just, it felt like this overwhelming like force calling and like pulling at me, like just pulling at me, like grabbing me and just slowly pulling me closer. And it was unbearable. It was so unbearable. And I didn't have the words to explain it to anyone. And when I would try to ask for help, it felt like somebody had their hand over my mouth and was like covering it. And I was trying to scream through and say, please, but I couldn't, I just couldn't, I couldn't get the words out. I just couldn't. And these were really dark, dark times. So I isolated myself. I didn't talk to anyone for like a year. I just would go to work and come home and drink. That's all I did. That's it. That's where everything went. Something about addiction that makes us think that every worst thing about us is true. And no one can tell you differently. I don't know how else to explain that, but to say it just like that. No one can tell me that I'm better than what I am because this is all I have. I've never known anything more. And I was sitting there like, what are you doing? Are you in jail again? Is this where you want to be? Is this what you want? Is this all you think that you can do? Are you even going to try? You haven't fought for yourself yet. You fought for what people believe you are. You fought for what people say you are. You let society tell you that just because you went to jail, just because you have an addiction that you mean nothing. I have value. And I realized that. And I fought for myself this time. And I really made a conscious effort to pay attention to my health, do things that made me feel better, work out, go to therapy, do some support groups, whatever I needed to do, and then COVID hit. That was two years ago in some change. And it was just like this immediate click of, are you going to continue to hurt everyone that loves you? Are you going to continue to put the people that stand up for you through pain? Why are you doing this to them? Why are you doing it to yourself? I mean, it was literally that quick, that easy. It was done. It was dead. Dead. And it was the easiest this time. And I don't know if it's because I've been to school now, so I understand the behaviors, the attachment. I understand it all, all the science behind it. But it was more of the spiritual aspect that came in this time. I realized that I was worthy of love. I'm worthy of great things. The things that I can do when I'm sober blow my fucking mind. I mean, when I really just focus on myself and growth and whatever I want to do, that was the best part of sobriety. I can do anything. I can try playing the guitar. I can go out and learn salsa dancing. I can go to the park and lay out and read a book. I can go bike riding. I can do any of this shit because I was stuck to a bottle all day. I never even, I wanted to do it, but I never even thought it was possible because I'm too drunk to do it. Or my brain wouldn't even let me formulate that as an option. And once I realized that I could get sober on my own terms, I didn't have to do it the way AA taught me. I didn't have to do it the way my sponsor taught me. I could do it whatever way works best for me. And that's what I did. I made my own routines. I created my own support group, Sober Girls Houston, because I realized support is what you need to survive. We're humans. If we don't have other humans around telling us good things and helping us grow, lifting us as we climb, we're just here just bumping around into each other, serving no real purpose. And I had to find that group. I had to find that support. And that was the most important thing to me in my sobriety, in making a safe space for other women because there aren't many. You're so raw when you're in recovery. I mean, you're just, you're just raw with feelings and emotions that you've never had before because you've numb them for so long. So the most important thing is to feel somewhere where you feel loved and safe. And I was, you know, my best friend got sober at the same time. So I really, I call her my sober anchor because when things get hard or I need someone to talk to, I have her. She doesn't live here, which was a big thing because I realized, oh, I need someone like actually here in the state with me. I need people. I need people. And I had to cut out all the people that didn't have my best intentions. I still like to go out. I still want to have a good time, but I had to teach myself that you don't have to be inebriated to do that. You can just go out, have a good time and remember it tomorrow. That's cool too. When you're in addiction, you're so, we're so smart, right? We're always plotting and planning and scheming, getting this money together to get this next bottle or getting this money together to buy these pills. We're always making a plan. Like, you know, as soon as you wake up in the morning, your day is already focused around getting your, you know, your bottle or getting your pills, whatever it is, you've got it all planned out. And so when you get sober, you can use that same creative energy into something that's actually beneficial for your life, right? So now when you get up, you're like, okay, I got to get this done. I got to get that done. And it just works in a different way. And so I think that was a big thing for me was realizing like, holy shit, I'm pretty smart. Like, if I need to get something done, I can get it done, you know? And I really felt stupid for so long, you know, I just kind of was like, uh, this is the best I can do when really I wasn't trying at all. You know, so being able to have that clarity to really put your goals in order and attack them one by one is something that sobriety gives you that's extremely powerful, that can help you set your life up in a way that you never even imagined, never even dreamed of how it could be. It's so good over here, I promise. I promise.",loaded_from_file,17929,THE JOURNEY From Addiction to Recovery - Danay's Story,1442.0,40,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00
MpC0YpmcdiM,"I lost my leg because of fent law and I know how deep in the trenches it can take us so now I've dedicated my life to going around telling my story in hopes of using my pain for the purpose of lifting others out of the darkness before it's too late for them. That's what I dedicated to full-time. We'll get into my van out there in the parking lot. This is the first journey for my van we call the Hillmobile. It's built out as a full RV. That's my house on wheels. We named it the Hillmobile. The group that I started about 13 months ago, we call the Hill family. Hill was an acronym for help, empathize, accept, and love. And like I said, fent law took me into dark places. I never even fathomed were possible. I went from being a soldier in the army to a homeless IV addict. I mean, it's just before you even realize that there is a problem, it has became so much of an overwhelmed strength in your life that it's beyond what you can fathom just by normalcy. There's nothing normal about it. For instance, me, I was a senior in high school in 9-11, happened. So I joined the army. I go in and since there was such a large influx of individuals pouring into the military all at one time, there were some safety precautions that were being overlooked. A harness failed and I fell from about 15 foot and landed standing upright and snapped both my legs. So at 19 years old, I was medically discharged from the army. I'm a service connected veteran because of this, but I was given the parting gift of an opiate addiction. For seven years, I went to the doctor and got my prescriptions, thinking that when the doctor said, you need this, that I needed it. Not realizing that the reason why it made me feel good was because I was getting intoxicated and it's going on and on and it's building up and up. And you don't even realize how big it's gotten until all of a sudden the government says, oh, we're giving out too many opiates. I get cut way back. I learned what withdrawals were. I mean, I didn't even realize that I had a problem until the problem was life controlling. And then somebody said, hey, I got a buddy that sells those on the street. That become too expensive very fast. Hey, you know heroin will do the same thing. Before I realized the snowball that was going on, I was a homeless IV addict. I was living in abandoned houses. I was at the bottom of it, man. And it had total control of my life until December 20 of 2022. When I got so intoxicated on illicit fentanyl, I laid there unconscious while kerosene heater fell on my leg, burned it so bad that they ended up having to amputate it. I was in Burn Unit ICU in Chapel Hill, North Carolina from December 20 of 2022 to February 8, 2023. And during that whole time in the hospital, you know how many friends from the street came and seen me? Not a one. But within 24 hours of me getting released from the hospital, the dealer that sold me the stuff called me. I said, I heard you was out of the hospital. I got that fire if you need any. So I got enough fire from you last time. It got laid on my heart that true love, because what the streets show you is not true love. True love is what matters. And that's where the Heel family was born. I started watching, I was wheelchair bound for about seven months. And I started watching recovery content on Facebook and TikTok and all them. And I happened across Benjamin Lerner, the man that introduced me, we was talking about at the Lost Voices Offent All Rally. This is how I met him. I started watching his content. Then a man named Josh Catlett, I contacted both of them, told them a little bit about my story, and they both invited me to come on with them and tell my story. So August 27, 2023, I went on Josh Catlett's YouTube and told my story on there. Three days later, I went on Benjamin Lerner's radio show. He hosted a radio show in Vermont called Clean Jams. I went on it three days later. And within a week, I had received over 5,000 messages of people reaching out telling me that they had been inspired through this. They were having problems with that. And it clicked to me, this is what I'm supposed to be doing. So I started a community we call the Heel Family. I started sharing my story. We started going out and doing communal events. March the 2nd, 2024, we hosted our first community event. We did a overdose awareness skydiving event at Skydive Rally in Raleigh, North Carolina. I had members of the community submit pictures of lost loved ones, and we wore collage shirts and took them on a jump with us. Then I went back to the town that I was burned in, the town I lost my leg in, Danville, Virginia. Went back there with a group, my whole family, a group and a few of my followers. We wouldn't pass out over 2,000 doses of Narcan, some canned food and different things of that nature. And it felt really good to go back to the town that I feel like I took from for so long. Living there as a homeless IV addict, all you do is take. When you're in that world of addiction, all you do is take. And so the entire concept of what Heel is about is about helping others. It's about lifting up others. Last year, exactly a year ago, I put a post on Facebook saying, theoretically, if I bought a van and I build it out as an RV, to travel the country as a volunteer motivational speaker, how many of y'all would ride along with me? And I got a positive response. In May, I bought the van. It's a 1993 Ford E-150, big high-top conversion van. And for the last seven months I've took and I stripped it down to bare metal and built, it's my home on wheels. It's the complete RV. And yesterday was the start of the first trip yet for the Heelmobile. It's finally on the road. Anybody wants to hop in that passenger seat with me? Let's take his trip because it promises to be a fun one. What I tell everybody is, if it's a town hall meeting, if it's a recovery center, if it's a book club, if it's something positive to send me a message, and I want to travel the country as a volunteer motivational speaker, just going all over, just trying to tell the story of how dark it can get to hopefully show them the beautiful light that could be at the end of the tunnel.",loaded_from_file,6197,Recovery - David Riggins' Story,538.0,41,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00
nhJskHOW05o,"So, where does your story begin? It begins, I guess, my story addiction began before I even started using drugs. Okay, some trauma happened in my life and I was trying to get away from it. I started using marijuana first, actually used marijuana a long time. Then I started drinking a little bit. Then with the marijuana, I started adding stuff to the marijuana. Then I let me to heroin, opioids, and then towards the end, the slow commitment to... The last result was fentanyl. It was 12 years old, so I'm now 54. I came in recovery when I was 51. So how does this recovery stuff go? It's going well. My life has changed. I'm working in recovery and I'm able to give somebody else some hope from my experiences. Letting them know there is another way out, which I never thought it was a way out for me. I thought I was going to die an addict, leading up to the results of what drugs would do to you. Actually, that's what really turned my life around is overdosing. First time ever, overdosing. That's what made me come into recovery. Overdosing was that a fentanyl? Yes, overdosing on fentanyl. Like I said, I started, we added stuff to the opioids and then it was fentanyl. It was to the point where the opioids wasn't making me feel the way I wanted to feel anymore. Fentanyl hit the streets, I believe back in for Rich in 2016, somewhere in there. I got a taste of that and then I was all to the races with that. That was the only thing that would make me feel outside of myself. Back then, we hear a lot of stories about fentanyl where people talk about it being in counterfeit pills. But we don't hear a lot of people talk about actively seeking fentanyl. They talk about how they thought it was a percocet and they thought it was a Xanax or something like that. Now I have done pills as well, Xanax, Oxyz, Perts. I did all those things too, but it was just something about, like I said, when I found out what it was and it made me feel some type of weight and it actually made me save money when I started using fentanyl. It was cheaper and I didn't have to use but a little bit to get where I wanted to be. But towards the end, when I went out, it was like I was searching for fentanyl. I was like, hey, you have fentanyl or that's where my mind, the insanity part was. It was like, if I found out somebody overdosed somewhere, I would say, oh, I got to have that. That's insane, insane. But in my mind, I thought that it wasn't going to affect me the way it affects others. I don't know why, until it did, until it did its job. So you'd hear about some of my overdosed and you'd want to go find that level of stuff. Exactly. Exactly. I've heard that before. That's kind of a thing. A behavioral thing that some users or addicts will do is if someone overdosed, if someone dies, they'll, well, that must have been good stuff. I'll go get some of that. That's how it is. But in my mind, I'm not thinking of death. In my mind, I'm thinking I can handle it because I know what I'm doing. Right. Yeah. So it wasn't that I went out, get it to kill myself. I just thought it would never happen to me. I know how to use it safely. That's how I thought. But apparently, that was never the, that was the wrong way of thinking, the same way of thinking. There's, there's, there's nobody to know what the dosage is like and what you get. That's something that a lot of people are involved in me and the folks that sometimes they, like if you get a counterfeit, Perkis saying, you know it's counterfeit, you know it's got fit. But you don't know whether it's got one milligram or five milligrams. Right. Five milligrams would be fatal. One milligram would be. Perkis. Productive dose, but there's no way to know. No way to know. You break it in half. What happened to it can be fatal. And you have almost do nothing. And actually I wasn't even thinking that way, like how much is in it. You know, that was never my thought. Like if it's too much or not enough, you know, of course I was doing the scientific part of it. You know, I just wanted, I just wanted it. You know, the overdose. Like I said, the overdose turned me around. And once I got the, the report back to blood work when I overdosed and finally got out of the hospital and some just told me just to look at the blood work and in the blood work, it was no heroin in it. It was fentanyl, Zanex, like they made a concoction up and the doctors told me, told my family, wherever she got this from. We know for sure some people that died of it. Yeah. And then when I saw that, I was like, you know what, I can't, I can't keep doing this, not just to my family or people that love me, but just to myself. You know, I can't do this no more. I don't want to die like that of my own doing. You know, so that's what turned me around was overdose. What do you remember about the overdose? I don't even remember. I don't even remember. You just woke up in the hospital? In the hospital and my family or people that was around me, they told me my story of the overdose. I didn't remember anything. I woke up to my, where I was falling, apparently I was falling out, you know, falling out on the streets or whatever. And I kind of like bust my head all open, you know, it's like to the white meat on my face. I had bruises all over my arms. You know, I was in really bad shape. And to, and really got me because normally I can remember, you know, even though I might, you know, go out or not overdose, but just be, you know, high, I usually can remember. And that's what really scared, that scared me too, because I usually can remember what took place or where I was or what I was doing. But at that, at that time of the overdose, I couldn't remember none of it. None of it. So that was scary as well for me. So you decided, no, not going to do it anymore. I had some help, you know, I had hope where I didn't have, you know, being homeless and stuff like that. I was part of my story, but it was about to be part of my story, you know, because my family, friends, just everybody just like, look, they didn't want to have me in there, you know, around them and I die, you know, from that experience. So they was like, you know, I had nowhere to go. You know, once in my life, I had nowhere to go. So once you get that spot where you want to get into recovery, what do you do? Act for the help. That's what I had to do. I asked for the help, you know, and then coming in recovery, I realized that I was not alone. You know, I wasn't the only person that was like this or thought like this or the thinking process. I wasn't alone. And when I seen that and really surrendered, I mean, I need some help, really not going to get help for my kids, for not going to jail, for the courts, none of that. You know, for me, I knew I had to do something quick, fast and hurry if I wanted to live. I asked for help. I asked for help and I hadn't looked back, you know, since, you know, I asked for help and I'm maybe not a lot of people because I understand, you know, when they come in here, I understand because I know that I think like that, you know, and it's not even to the fact that I don't think about using, but put it this way, I do, but the desire of it is getting further and further apart as long as I stay in the program and do with the program of people that's been recovering and ask for help, you know, and understand I'm not the only one I think like that. That's a big deal. Being around people who know what you're going through. Absolutely. That's the only way I can understand. I can understand from doctors and psychiatrists and all that. I can get it because I'm like, are you an addict? Right. Do you use drugs? And they tell me, no, I'm like, well, how do you think you can help me? You know? How do you think you can help me? You know, until I came here and I know people that's been through what I've been through, you know, still going through what I'm going through, but able to get through it. Now I'm like, how do you get through it? Ask somebody. Put my pride aside because I want to live. You know, I want to live today, you know, and help someone else live. It seems like that could be important in helping someone else. Absolutely. That's a great motivator to avoid relapse. You're not just letting you down. Right. There's a lot of people, you're helping that a relapse would send a message to them that could be devastating. Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. That extra accountability. And then it also helped me with being, I was so used to being selfish and self-centered. It was all about me, you know, whatever Tylene wanted, about me, me, me. I wasn't caring about no one else's feelings. Nothing. Now I'm learning how to be selfless by helping someone, you know, and not looking for nothing to return. You know? No, not looking for nothing to return. But there's a cool personal reward in that too. That is in return. But it's not. I totally can't say that. What's that message? What's that most important thing that people who see as being grown? There's hope. You're not alone. You're not by, it's nothing wrong with you. You know? You just have a disease. You know? That people didn't understand it was a disease. It was like, oh, it's drugs. You can get all drugs. And the thing is, you say, people say that, but if that was the case, it wouldn't be as many addicts as it is if we could just stop. You know? But there's ways. There's people, you know, a community of people that's doing the same thing, the same goal, you know? And there is help out there. You just got to surrender and ask for the help and get out your own way.",loaded_from_file,9614,"FENTANYL - RECOVERY ""Just ask for help"" - episode 258",872.0,48,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00
OSAKdvVf-5c,"I am the worst type of addict, and I say that not like degrading myself, but any mind-altering substance. I truly love not feeling myself. I always had to be numb of some way, shape, or form. Any chemical that I can get my hands on that would change how I felt was definitely what I would do. I'd go for it. So I've had tremendous problems and horrific addictions to the majority of the downers, the opiates, and the stimulants. Those were my drugs of choice for a long, long time, 21 years. I took my first hit of crack cocaine at 12 years old from my stepmother. I was in a crack accident with my dad in Colorado, and he was drinking and driving. He rolled the car, and we rolled eight times. He got ejected on the second roll and was deceased. He died there. Then the next day, I saw my stepmom and my older brother in the bathroom smoking something, and 12-year-old curiosity. I went in there, and I'd seen what they were doing. Of course, I wanted to try it because they were doing it, so I wanted to do it. I took my first hit at that 12-year-old right after losing my father, and I fell in love. Most people say it would have been so hard on you, but I grew up in an extremely chaotic, alcoholic, drug addict family. The fighting, the violence, the hatred was out of control. There was no real love there except for my mom, but it kind of dwindled away as her alcoholism progressed to a point, well, until she drank herself to death. Yeah. People, my life, I've been told by numerous people when I tell my story of different rehabs or facilities or detoxes. When I go in, they say I should contact Lifetime or Hallmark, because my whole life story would be a perfect movie of the real growing up in an addicted family. Growing up, I think there was short periods of time where it was normal. Our normal was my dad drinking or getting drunk and only hitting my mom a couple of times a night. That was my normal. I think I compared my life a lot to my friend's life. I would see my friends from school or where I lived. David had such normal lives, and that was taboo to me. I'm like, why is it like that? They're so loving and caring. I'm like, it's weird. But eventually, I'd be jealous. I'm like, I really want that. I want a loving family. So I didn't get it until I actually met my partner. That's when I actually felt that love from another person that I should have had my whole life as a kid or growing up. I'm grateful to be alive. I've OD'd three times in my life. The last time, it was probably the worst. It was six Narcans, and I was dead for 21 seconds. I don't know why I'm still here, but it was enough to shake me to my core. I never want to go back to that again. I think it scared me enough. At that point, when I OD'd, it was, I was already at a point in my addiction where I just wanted to die. I had no hope of living. I tried to get sober numerous times. It had never worked. I just couldn't, I could not put it down on my own. But ever since that OD, I have never felt such desperation to stay sober in my life. It's like an overwhelming feeling of, no matter what, I'm staying sober. And I wake up with it every day. I remember exactly, I wake up, I remember exactly what I went through, and it just helped drive me to stay sober and help other people. That's where I'm at right now in my recovery. I really help a lot of people in my network of sobriety people. I remember waking up to a light almost similar to this. It was in a hospital, and I had probably had six doctors around me. And they were just, if I could just print the image from my brain on paper of their faces and jaws and just their mouths were wide open, or like, we don't know how you're alive. We don't. And I remember once, a lot of them cleared out, one doctor, he said, kid, you're going to die next time if you do this. I guarantee it. And that kind of gave me enough to, like, I realized he was serious. And I realized that was my third overdose. And I'm too scared to test it. You know, I'm not a cat. I don't got extra lives. But I do know that I was at a point where I just wanted to be done. And I just couldn't, I didn't know how to be done. And I think that overdose just, it shook me up to do whatever. And it gave me the ability to actually listen to other people. Like people who were actually trying to help me, good, positive people, recommending rehabs and okay, I'll go, I'll do it. You know, instead of, oh, I got this, I'll do it on my own. Because I, 21 years of addiction, I've never once had it on my own. I can never have done it on my own. So it gave me that ability to actually listen to the advice and what other people are trying to help me with. It was scary at first. You know, this, I've been to a few rehabs in my life. And this one, it was scary because I didn't, I didn't know if I was going to have any permanent damage from that overdose. As the doctor stressed it was, you may have, you know, permanent damage. It just, we don't know until, you know, as you get yourself back to normal. But the rehab, when I got into detox, I was excited at first. And then, you know, of course, with the withdrawals, they started, they started coming on and I was, you know, blessed to be in a detox where they were able to medicate me to where I didn't have to feel such severe. And that's, so it made it a little bit easier. But after the detox phase, I was, I was excited. I was just, I was happy to be sober and happy to get sober. I have been in and out of sobriety 21 years, my addiction, 21 years I've been dealing with this. And it took, for me to stay sober, it takes the gift of desperation for me. I can't vouch for everyone, but for me it takes the desperation that I feel and I pray for it every morning because it's, I don't want to lose it. I feel that if I lose that gift of desperation that I may start going back to old ways, going back out. And that's, in that part scares me. So I wake up, I pray for that. I joined, so after rehab I joined a Alcoholics Anonymous. And I say, I use Alcoholics Anonymous because the Alcoholics Anonymous program is the founder of 12 Steps, which the recovery program of all recovery programs, that is the founder of it, like the grandfather of it. And I found that the type of addict that I am, even if I take a drink of wine or alcohol, my brain, something happens in my brain where I go off to, I straight to fentanyl or straight to the other stuff. So I do Alcoholics Anonymous as my sobriety, my program. And I joined the clubhouse here in San Antonio and I just dove in. You know, I didn't let my scared, being scared get ahead of me. I just, I raised my hand, I found a sponsor. And the people that I let in my circles, so my circle is fairly small. I got five people, but it's five people that I love unconditionally. They're there for me 24 seven. I mean, there's times where I'll wake up from a dream, a using dream, and I'll call them, like two in the morning, and they'll answer. I don't have to worry about them never answering. But I do the steps. I fellowship. That was a huge one for me because in recovery, a lot of young people, especially like me, we get bored really quick. We a lot of us can't sit still. We just get sick of doing the same thing, which is, you know, work, meeting, steps, home. You know, like a routine almost. And for me, I had to change that. I had to shake it up. I had to get involved with the clubhouse, which they have events. They have, I mean, every month we have something going on, whether it's fundraisers or awareness. You name it, it's what keeps, and that's what keeps me sober. Especially at the end of the day, I'm so exhausted from just doing everyday stuff with the clubhouse alone, never alone my personal life. It's what keeps me sober. I haven't had the thought to use since. You know, and it's, I've been tested in sobriety. Big triggers for me. The loss of the loved one, like of my dog, I had to put my dog down. And my dog was my best friend for 13 years of my using. She went to rehab with me. And I did that, and I got to stay sober through it. And the only way I was able to do that is with the help of my friends, my fellowship, my clubhouse, and my sponsor, of course. So that is like, I can't stress it enough when I talk to other people in programs, like staying sober is the struggle. Anybody can get sober, anybody can get sober for 24 hours. It's staying sober for that stretch, the long time, and that's the tricky part. And I think everyone's different. Everyone has their own way of doing it. For me, it was, I had to throw myself in there and be involved and continue to be involved. I'm doing other stuff with other areas of recovery, like sharing my story. That is, it's the highlight of my month. I'm doing it three times a month now. Different parts of this, you know, San Antonio, the rehabs, detoxes, or psychiatric hospitals, or even jails. I don't know, I haven't gotten there yet, but I am signed up. It's, you get this overwhelming feeling of like, I know my story can reach someone and help them. So it's just, it's exciting. Never lose hope. I think that was, there was parts of my life where I was so down in the dumps and, and I thought, I always told myself, this is it. This is what my life is going to be, you know, homeless, destroyed my life, killed relationships, and I couldn't keep a needle out of my arm. I accepted that. And there was times where I had lost hope. But there was always somebody else in recovery. You know, I know that people that, people that watch this, I, I just hope that if they're struggling with addiction, or if they have no someone that's struggling with addiction, there's no, they don't have to plan some big intervention or, you know, wait for them to destroy their life. It's what we call in AA is planting the seed, the seed of sobriety. And it was planted in me very early on. So, you know, taking someone to an AA meeting or just getting them a book, an A book or AA book or whatever sobriety book. And just getting that, just getting that seed planted. I think that that made the biggest difference. So every time I knew, I felt like I was done using, say I was on a bender for a month or six months. And I knew I was sick of it. I wanted to go back to sobriety. I knew exactly where to go. And that was, you know, to an AA meeting or to an AA meeting or heroin and on this meeting. And the second you walk into one of those meetings, someone will greet you. It's, it's, I've never had someone not greet me, except in a Spanish meeting. I didn't, I didn't know Spanish. I didn't know I was walking into one of those. They are like looking at me like I was an alien or something and I'm like, oh, wrong meeting. But, um, it's somebody will always reach their hand out. And that's, you know, that is, that is such a comforting feeling if you're just in a hopeless state of mind and you just want sobriety. Even if it doesn't stick, you just, just to go and feel that compassion that someone's still there, people are still there to help you. That is the biggest thing I can, I can recommend to anyone.",loaded_from_file,11106,The Seeds of Sobriety,1009.0,32,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00
pbKtwbNGTc8,"Basically, I was a math user for 20 years and I'm a survivor of fentanyl poison. I used that to turn something bad into something positive and try to save lives and try to save other people from going through what I went through and put my family through. I understood what people kept force feeding me and telling me for all that time about what was wrong with my actions and what I was consuming and stuff and I could never see it. Just how the the dramaticness of how bad it really was until I did get clean. I look back at myself and I'm like holy cow how am I still here? Also, I didn't realize the magnitude of how big this issue really is. I thought it was more isolated with me and my peers that kind of thing but it's not. This is an epidemic as far as the fentanyl goes. It's nothing that anybody's used to and it's only gonna get worse. I got so bad using math that there's a point when you're an addict that you start out you do it for the thrill and you do it to feel good and then you get to where you're addicted of course and you're using it all the time and then one day you wake up and you have to have it. I was to the point that anybody that's used or know anything I was shooting I was shooting Graham Graham and a half shots which is deadly doses and that's how addicted to the substance I was and I got to a point one day with my girlfriend I didn't have any and I was what they called dope sick severely dope sick and we got with a crowd that I knew was a really bad crowd but they offered me some dope and I knew I shouldn't attack it because of who they were but I was so sick that it didn't matter to me and I hit this and it literally it felt like my whole entire body left my soul it just it I've never been so scared of my life and I knew I knew when Herms didn't certain what had happened I done some fentanyl and I called my mama and I told her because that's that's the last number I called at this time I couldn't even hardly hold my eyes open and I called her and I told her to let my uncle know because I was outside his house and he was a drug dealer I told her to let him know that I'm coming to his house that I've OD on fentanyl and when I got to his house and he had received a phone call so he was watching for me and he heard something slam up against his door when he opened the door I was laying on his front porch I was completely blue had absolutely no pulse no heartbeat no nothing I was dead he hit me three times the Narcan with CPR he got my heartbeat back and they kept trying and trying and trying to take me to the hospital I kept refusing the hospital and I would die about about every hour I died I'd have to break pull out the Narcan and hit me again with Narcan and this continued for nine hours before they finally got me to where they didn't have the Narcan me that you know I was breathing on my own and one of the ladies that was with us she was counting every breath I take I was taking about a breath a minute and that continued for about eight hours before I completely made it through it and I said you know I'm done I am completely done I've got to get help well I started reaching out to rehabs and stuff and DJ Laurie Aschenfelder's son he's my best friend he was the one that came there with me and the picked me up from that place he said man we're going home we're getting out of here and on the way on the way back I said man let's go to rehab they said what I said let's go to rehab I said we can do a lot better than this he agreed with me a little did I know he just had got out of jail and he had literally a stack of rehab applications he was already on that page he was waiting to go well we finally got accepted to go to Bethel colony of Mercy rehab and we scheduled to go and a couple weeks before we went he came up to my house and we smoked a joint and was hanging out and he pulled out fentanyl and started smoking it and even at that time I didn't know what I know now I wouldn't educate on it but I knew that it was a different it was a different animal and I would always preach to him because he he was involved with the heroin and stuff so I didn't know much about it because I knew it was deadly but I didn't know because I was with the speed and that's just two different crowds you know but I would always preach to him man you gotta leave that stuff alone you're not gonna you're not gonna make it it will kill you it's not if it's when finally I preached to him so much about it that he broke down he kind of got angry with tears in his eyes he said leave I know I know enough he said it will kill me he said I can't put it down he said but I don't care if you take my dead body and take it to schools whatever you gotta do if I say one kid with my death I didn't die in vain when he said that every hair on my body stood up and he went home he made it through that night and then the very next morning I got the phone call that Lori walked downstairs and felt him dead with that same fintan on his lap and I really didn't have a pot to pee in at that time I had nothing everything I owned was fit in a backpack I ended up going to that same rehab that we're supposed to go to together wearing his clothes never got to see my brother again so after that I started talking to people in rehab and when I got out of rehab I had a lot of peers that come up to me and asked me if I'd help them get into rehab and stuff and I started doing that and it it really humbled me and then it finally it clicked that people will come to me and talk when they won't come to somebody else they're too scared to go to somebody else they'll come to somebody like me so I started I started using that to my advantage and the more the more that I started doing that the the more it's humbled me and the more it fuels me the the spread fentanyl awareness so here I am I have literally literally lost every single friend I got to fentanyl and I ain't got none left they're all gone and you know everybody they can say that they can they can sort of relate they've got somebody they've lost a child or they they they know somebody's died from fentanyl but when you're somebody that's lived that lifestyle you all your peers they're addicts and when you start losing every single person that you've ever had in your life you start waking up a little bit and that brings a different magnitude to life and death and people watch these videos and yeah it might it might touch their heart or something but then they turn off that channel and they go on about their life and I'm not pointing a finger at them I just would like for them to stop and think what you're gonna do about it because our government ain't helping us what you're gonna do about it it's up to us to beat this it's up to us to save lives and even if it's something as simple as when you see somebody out at town when you're buying groceries or something tell them about fentanyl that one person might go tell somebody else and it might save a life it's that easy it's like I was speaking I was sharing I just went through my photos last night and I was sharing some of my old pictures with my mom and I'd found an old picture I had never showed her is right before I got baptized and it was at that rehabs where I got baptized it was a Christian rehab and there's a group estimated 15 20 people in that group was getting baptized that night and I started counting them and there's only six of us still alive all that crowd and what it is is people go to a rehab or a jail or something and they've got that tolerance their bodies use those opioids and then when they get out they go to try to do the same as that dose that they was doing before they went in and it's deadly one of my biggest messages to people now that they understand in the Narcan is don't you just carry one nasal spray that ain't enough you're gonna need at least two or three if somebody's overdosing on fentanyl before the ambulance even gets there and if they're poisoned on fentanyl and yes there is a huge difference you all you can do is pray I mean really that's all you can do yes of course you can hit them with Narcan and all but until they get an IV of Narcan in you that's you just buying time you know what really brought that point to mine is last year we was doing a rally in Tampa Florida and I'm not gonna say any names because they're amazing people I don't don't put on a spot like that but they we was handing out Narcan and I was afraid they'd run out so they've taken the boxes and they was taking it singling on them out you know they come to a pack that you they've singling them out and give them out one at a time and I said there's a reason there's two of them in that pack and what you're doing is a wonderful cause but you're actually kind of you're kind of contradicting it too as well you know so I figured I'd take the time to kind of inform people about that you know I was at the community center our local community center last weekend and there was a band came up there and started playing for us and the community center it's known it's the the older crowd the retired retirement crowd out there you know and they had a few autistic kids it's beautiful they was out there dancing they've stationed them had a clog and stuff and they this guy stopped the show and he he made a speech to the older crowd and he told them he said because they're used to bluegrass that kind of music and he's playing rock and roll and he said I appreciate y'all showing up I know y'all aren't used to this kind of music he said but I would hate to see this beautiful thing y'all got going out the community center die at this at this time he said you're going to have to start bringing in the younger generation to keep this movement going and it'll have to be something to interest them change is good and that applies to recovery as well if we don't start talking to the youth if we don't start helping the youth we ain't got no hope it's just don't keep getting worse and worse and worse because we we as adults and all we already know better we we're already we're already educating ourselves on this and we've already we've already lived our prime but the youth they're the ones that we need to help because one day they're going to be in our shoes running this country and that's the ones that we can make a change with is the youth and it needs to be spoke about in schools they shouldn't be one single kid that don't know about

rf3yQhKwGJU,"When I was getting high, I just didn't think there was a way out. I thought, I'm never going to get back to that successful hardworking girl. And today I can say that I've finally gotten back to that point. I wanted to share my story about my recovery journey in hopes to give someone a push that it is possible. I'm from a small town, Danville, Virginia, and I grew up in a great family. My parents did divorce at a young age, but they both are remarried and my mom's engaged. It gets along for the most part. But they all come together for us, me and my two older brothers. Very supportive. My family's a huge part of my testimony. I can't thank them enough for the actions they took to save my life. I'd say around 18, 19 years old, I started drinking a little bit more. I was dating a guy who I didn't know at the time, but he used cocaine, but he also sold it. And it wasn't, to my knowledge, as frequent. Like he had a full-time job as well. So he would have parties all the time and I would drink occasional cocaine use. Not often, but it wasn't really my cup of tea. I didn't really like something that made my heart race. Keep me up all night. I love one thing about me. If you knew me, I love sleep. So uppers wasn't like as an addictive thing to take over. Fast forward, that relationship ended. And I went away to college. I got my B.S. degree in psychology. Learned a lot about mental health. When I graduated, I got a job in the mental hospital. And when I was working there, I had met my next boyfriend, who, unfortunately, was very, very abusive. I mean, I had broken ribs. He would do whatever he could to manipulate a situation to make me feel that I wasn't good enough. I wasn't ever going to meet anybody else but him. Just an overall very toxic situation. It lasted around five years before I was able to pull myself out of that situation. And I started to heal. And after that, I met a guy who was single and I wanted to be in a relationship. And he was a pastor's son, came from a great family. I couldn't find anything bad about him. I didn't really know people that knew him. I knew people that knew his family, which were great people. And he introduced me to the pain pills, which led to heroin, then led to fentanyl. And it was pretty bad. Just, it took a while for me to get addicted to the heroin because I didn't know the people that my boyfriend at the time knew. So it was like, I really cared what people think I was a people pleaser. So going around Danville where I'm from, getting drugs, it just, it just opened up a whole new world for me. Once it started to consume me, I started meeting these people I never met. People, you know, in different neighborhoods, grew up different way. Next thing you know, it consumed me. I mean, I had another friend that was addicted as well. And she was like one of my best friends. And, you know, just, I felt on top of the world when I was getting high. And I think I wasn't healed from the abuse of relationship I was in. And that carried over into my next relationship. And I feel devoid of drugs. A huge breaking point for me was when that boyfriend who introduced me to the drugs got incarcerated, I was left kind of fined for myself. So I was meeting the dealers. I was, you know, putting myself out there going an hour and a half each way to North Carolina back. So three hour round trip just to get high. And it was pure fentanyl that I was using. I got arrested in North Carolina one time and went to the hospital as well. I had an infection in my bones, which I didn't quite understand the concept of what was going on with my health because I was so high. I was makes you fogbrained, makes you not in touch with reality. You know, people in my family started noticing. I'd lost a lot of weight. Oh, I am as 200 pounds now. Wait, I'm as 100 pounds when I was using. You know, my two older brothers in the military, my dad's, you know, very strict on me growing up. And they all were working together behind the scenes to try to save my life. I knew better and I did it anyways. I mean, I just, one thing I was, I was very naive. I looked for love in their own places. I trusted people and all it takes is that one bad day being around the wrong crowd. People who surround yourself really matter because if I just would have picked up on the signs, because there was definitely tons of red flags in my relationship. I mean, it took me at least a good year into the relationship of the guy I was talking to that introduced me to drugs to really fully grasp what was going on. From him having surgery, he had hernia surgery. I remember walking in the living room one time at my house and he was just pushing his chest, trying to get the stitches to break to the measured break. And they tell you not to make movements of your stomach if you have hernia surgery. And what it was, is he was trying to go back and get more pain pills from the emergency room and hindsight, you know, I realized. So, you know, and then next thing you know, you know, I'm prescribed Vivalance, which is kind of like Adderall. I never abused that. I took it as I should, but when I took his pain pill, when he offered it to me and it mixed with the Vivalance, it was like an upper and a downer and it gave me kind of like a euphoric feeling. Like I was, I mean, I was focused at work, you know, getting a lot done. I'm doing my reports on time and it just made me feel so good. And that's where the addiction started was that one pain pill. I mean, mixing it with my prescribed medication, which, you know, at the time, you know, I thought was okay, but truthfully, did I need it? No, because I right now, I work very hard. I've actually had the same job for a year today. And I mean, I love my job. I work hard. Our performance is great. I have such wonderful coworkers that treat, treat like family. I don't need any altering substances, any controlled substances to live a normal life. So that's one thing I learned through my addiction. That really, you know, a positive thing that came out of it is before I used fentanyl, before I used cocaine, when I was drinking here and there, sometimes every day, I thought that life was okay until I went through addiction. And now I'm so grateful for the experiences I had because I'm able to be happy sober. I'm able to not drink. I'm able to, you know, spend time with my family without being hungover, actually show up. I'm there. I'm there for my friends. You'd be surprised the amount of people that reach out to me that were once where I was for help. I mean, I've even this morning, I had a mom message me on Facebook. I had another friend text me, she realized I wanted some advice. It's just, you know, it just, once you're further, far along enough in your recovery and, you know, that you've changed and you set boundaries for yourself, you know, you're able to help those people from where you once were. Now, I can't say I would ever hang out with certain people because, you know, I have to say notice some things. I have to be very intentional about what I do. And that's why recovery is kind of easy for me. I don't have cravings. I mean, at the beginning, yeah, I did. But I just have to be very selective about who I spend my time with. Surrounding myself with family is very important. It's just my family is a huge part of my story of how I got arrested as well. It's a crazy story. I actually got arrested a few times. I got a DWI when I was 25 and actually woke me up from drinking and driving. I should have never did that. I was at home fine. My ex-boyfriend text me, wanted me to meet him out. And I was in the bathtub taking a bubble bath, literally. And I got up and I left. I get to the place. I may have a few shots and I blacked out. I don't even remember leaving. I went to go just hang out and give them a ride home and I'm getting pulled over. I was pulled over on the side of the road and I guess making a phone call. And that was a huge eye opener to me. And then fast forward to my next relationship when I started using harder drugs. My dad worked with Patty with the Hope Center and the magistrate and police officers. They knew I had a worn out for my arrest. I went to meet my dad, just me and him for lunch at a pizza place in Danville. So embarrassing. I was when it sat down, I was three hours late to dinner. My dad still sitting there in the restaurant. I go inside. I see him, maybe a hundred pounds. I had on a big baggy shirt because I didn't want him to see the track marks on my arms. And I sit down and he lets me order my food. So I don't I don't think my family's even on to me having a warrant at all. And I sit down, he lets me order my food. He gets up and goes to his restroom. Well, when he comes back, he sits down for maybe a minute and cops around on my table. I was sitting at inside of a restaurant. But I was so mad at my dad. But let me tell you what, that saved my life. I got arrested. I got five additional charges for having cocaine, fentanyl. I can't even remember all types of stuff in my purse from other people because you never wanted to leave your stuff where you were. Because if you're around other addicts, they'll take it. You know, they're going to use your drug. So I had all that stuff from my house in my purse and got arrested. Got five charges going from the magistrate. She sends me back to the holding cell for maybe 30 minutes. My bond wasn't me five thousand, but my dad called the magistrate and got them to raise my bond 15,000 because he told her my life's in her hands. And somehow I came up with the money bonded out. But I was going to attempt to get sober at that point. I knew I was going to have to go for a trial after I was bonded out. So I knew I had to do something different. But I wasn't quite there yet. You know, it's just I'm still in the midst of addiction. I'm still high at that point in front of the magistrate. I compared rehab to what the mental hospital was mentally. So I used to work in the mental hospital. So I was thinking I'm going to go into rehab and it's going to be all these people, you know, in like hospital outfits and these rooms. Recovery is so different than what I imagined. Rehabs were nothing like that. I started off with Hope Center. I went there. I didn't make it but three weeks, but it laid a foundation for the rest of my life. And I know a lot of people were like, dang, she didn't even make it for three weeks. But I made it and then I fell as soon as I got kicked out. I a couple of days later, I tried to do it on my own. I was like, I got this. I know I'm going to go back to jail because I was court ordered there. So I relapsed and Patty Johnson came to my house drug testing me in front of my mom and which was a blessing again and took me immediately to the Reginocyst Center. And that's in Colonial Heights and I was there for seven and a half months. And during that seven and a half months, I had to go back to jail for being kicked out of the Hope Center. Because I had to go back to court and be court ordered somewhere else. They made me sit there for five weeks. So I went back for that five weeks, though, and I was sober this time. So I wasn't withdrawn in jail, which by the way, was the worst thing. Withdrawing in jail is miserable. You're sweating, your bones hurt. It's just a terrible experience. But once you get to the through the physical part and the pain and your brain starts to heal and you start making better choices, I realized, you know, I need to stick with the program. I need to I'm just not ready yet. So I stuck through Reginocyst seven and a half months. I got kicked out of Reginocyst, not for drug use, but for vaping. I know it was against the rules and. Did it anyways. And, you know, that's that addict's behavior. I still was trying to work myself through. But you know what? I realized a whole lot. I met a lot of people in rehab, a lot of good people that are still a part of my life today. You know, I feel like the people pleasing and me being naive is huge thing that led me into addiction because a lot of people back home are like, I can't believe hearing God on drugs. Like she has an education. She, you know, really cared about her appearance and I was on drugs. All that went down to the drain. It's nothing but God that I'm still alive today because. He's giving me back everything and so I just got married on July 13th. I have a stepdaughter now who's living with us and, you know, it's just amazing what God will do if you just allow him. And the last time I used fentanyl, that was it for me. I'll never forget it. Being an Arkhand. It was the worst feeling in my life and I left it where it was. You know, I just remember waking up. It was like I was floating. It was like a dark tunnel. Like it was soon as our Arkhand. I when I came to the smells, the sounds, the colors, everything's enhanced. So it was like everybody's talking, but it's so loud. Like ringing and crazy thing about the last time I used fentanyl was it was the least amount I've ever did. I was sober for 90 days after continuous use of two years of fentanyl. But I used to do what they call wax bags. There was just a very little bit of point two in each bag. I used to could do 50 of those a day. The last time I used, I did maybe a fourth of just one bag and I didn't shoot it. I snorted it. And that was the last time I used and I overdosed that very last time doing what I thought, oh, I can do it if I do it just a little bit. You know, like you think you're invincible, but no. That was enough for me to want to never go back. It is just crazy to look back on it and the pictures, what I looked like and the videos I've seen of myself, nodded out. And one of those videos, my mom said, I just want you to get sober so you can help the people out or where you are now. And that's what I'm doing. You know, I do the best I can to get back and to let people know that there is hope and recovery. It's hard. It's not easy, but it's possible. And don't let the the drug lie to you that there is hope because when I was getting high, I just didn't think there was a way out. I thought I'm never going to get back to that successful, hardworking girl. And today I can say that I've finally gotten back to that point.",loaded_from_file,14294,FENTANYL RECOVERY - Erin Roberts' Story - episode 220,1100.0,6,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00
spELnY_qbAc,"ago I was really, really sick. I had been diagnosed with fibromyalgia after the side of my only brother. My body hurt for about seven years. I had two small children and I was putting myself through college so the doctors prescribed me opiates. And I ended up abusing those pills and being completely dependent upon them. I ended up getting in trouble with the law by driving home after having some alcohol. And so I was in a spot where it was live or die and I decided to live. My kids had to go live with my mom for a little while and the night after they left I fell apart. I ended up getting so intoxicated I had to be carried home. And not only was my body dying, my organs were shutting down but my brain was dying and I had about a three second short term memory on a good day. I tried to go to work that night and ended up with my head resting on the toilet at O'Malley Steak Pub in Palmer Lake. And I mentioned that because that's where I did most of my recovery. I know a lot of people have the privilege of going to treatment or something like that and finding support. And I had isolated so much because of violence and my substance use that I didn't have any support. I didn't have any insurance because I was a waitress and I could not go to treatment. So I went into the doctor and I said I need your help to get off of these pills because if I don't I'm going to die. And I knew I was going to die probably within the next few days. And so I used what's called harm reduction and I used medicated assisted treatment to help me come off of the medication that I was on. And it took about two months for my withdrawal symptoms to stop. But after that is when I had to start my counseling for my DUI classes. And today I still see that same counselor and I have continued to change my behaviors every single day since then. So medically assisted. Yeah. Is that like Suboxone? For some people at Suboxone one of the medications I was on was actually methadone. And so that's another medication that people use. However, since that's what I was abusing it was obviously not a good choice to help me come off of it. Even though I did cut down what I had left until it was gone. The doctor also gave me a clonidine patch which is for blood pressure and some Xanax and told me to use that during the acute withdrawal symptoms. And so that's what I did. And then after I stopped shaking I started coming off of the Percocet which is the other medication I was on. And I started practicing yoga as well. I got almost all of my medicine from the doctor. There was a short time where I did buy some methadone from somebody. But all of the Percocet I got from the doctor. So yeah. And it was before fentanyl was in everything luckily. They actually tried to put me on fentanyl patch. But it thankfully didn't work well with me. So I ended up just on the methadone and Percocet. It's interesting because the first time I actually used substances was when I was about, I don't know, three or four. And a friend at church gave me some Tums and he was a grownup and he was like, here this is candy. And so that kind of started an unhealthy relationship with medication. And a few years later his son who was a teenager assaulted me while I was sleeping. And I was about five or six when that happened. I didn't tell anybody until years later but I ended up confronting him about it and letting him know that I remembered and that I hoped he never did it to anybody else. And then a few years later my parents were married and they had five kids. They ended up divorcing and my mom remarried. From that time on I was raised in a home that was terrifying. The first time I was strangled I was 11 for saying something I wasn't supposed to. Everything in my life was controlled from the clothes that I wore to how I did my hair to the food that we were allowed to eat. In high school I ended up getting a boyfriend after experiencing a second sexual assault. But this one was in the hallway in front of all of my classmates while they were just walking by and laughing and calling me names. I got a boyfriend and we ended up getting pregnant after a few months and having a little boy. We ended up breaking up, getting back together, breaking up and eventually staying apart. And then after I was with him I dated another person who was quite controlling and then I started a job in the big city near the little town that I grew up in. On my first day of work my trainer invited me back to his house. I was 19. He made me a drink and I remember about 10 minutes. I was sexually assaulted all night and had no idea that that's what was happening until years later. After that I was like on a violent roller coaster of using substances to feel better and putting myself in dangerous situations. And then bad things happening. When I was 23 I went to the bar that I worked at one night and this really handsome guy came in. We ended up getting married a few months later and having a daughter. When we separated the only thing he left me with was that daughter and a burned scar on my arm which is now covered with an incredible tattoo that says you have no power over me. Because I want to remind everybody and every substance that I am the one in control of my own life. After we divorced I got with somebody even more dangerous than he was and then yet again. After my third marriage that's actually the marriage that I found recovery in. So I was married to somebody who was unkind to me and also physically abusive to my children. After leaving him and being in recovery I got educated as a confidential victims advocate and I learned what domestic violence was. I learned what sexual violence was and I learned how I was adding to my own suffering. It was not my fault that people hurt me especially when I was a child but it was absolutely my responsibility to learn from it and prevent it from happening again which is what I didn't do until I was about 35 years old. After that I had a couple of jobs as I was healing and then I worked as a victims advocate for about five years supporting other people just like me. They would see my tattoo and they would say Tiffany you're one of us. And one day one of my friends Raquel invited me to this event. She's like Tiffany I need your energy there because I had started practicing energy work. I showed up and it was for teenagers struggling with suicide. Robby's hope was there having an event for these teenagers and after that Raquel and I started supporting teenagers in Palmer Lake. Eventually the pandemic happened and we trained as recovery coaches and I actually got to start my own program called Unbroken which is recovery from intimate partner violence for people just like me. And it walks you through basically my recovery journey and helps people learn to come out of fight or flight to deescalate their nervous system because intimate partner violence not only contributes to mental health challenges but it can affect our physical health as well. And so today I am in recovery from both domestic and sexual violence. I am in recovery from a substance use disorder and I am in recovery from mental health challenges that came along with those. I didn't think it was ever possible but today my life is safe. Today I own a home and today my son is making me a grandma. His wife is in labor right now. None of this would be possible if I didn't have recovery and all I did was do what was best for me every single day and that's why I'm alive today. It's really, really common that people repeat their cycle of violence over and over and over again. And when I was shown the power and control wheel and the cycle of violence I saw how I was adding into my own suffering. I saw the target that I would put on my own back letting people know I'm a person you can hurt. That's really how I used to live my life because I felt I deserved it. I felt like because I was already, you know, because I was already damaged and broken as a child that as an adult I had to be the same way. So where are you at now? You're good now? Yeah, most days I'm good now. Almost every day. Some days I have hard days. You know, sometimes memories come up or nightmares, things like that. And I have to practice extra breathing exercises, do yoga, call my therapist. But most days I spend in gratitude. Most days I do breathing exercises and just notice the beauty in the world around me. Today I spend time with my husband, my friends. I have the best job in the world that I absolutely love to go to every day that I actually helped create. So today I'm where I never ever thought that I would be. People that are enduring domestic violence right now, what's that thing they need to know? That they have the power, that they are not broken and that they are worthy of finding love that feels like love. Whatever that means to them. It's really, really tricky because some situations are not life-threatening and some are. But the best way is getting support, finding a person who believes you and can help you find resources. Asking for help. Yeah. That's the hardest thing to do, but it's the most important. you",loaded_from_file,9151,DOMESTIC VIOLENCE - UNBROKEN,769.0,56,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00
S_5-OWUU0Xo,"My story of addiction started when I was about 18 years old and I dabbled with methamphetamines for about a year and a half. I found out I was pregnant and I miscarried and then found out I was pregnant about a month after that as I was still an active drug addiction again and I quit everything cold turkey. I wanted to change my life around and I had seven years sober. 2020 was when I relapsed for a three-year, very dark drug-induced person. There was no way out, it felt like. And then I was stopped by the police with my four-year-old daughter in the car and they took her. I kind of had two options that night as I was walking home barefoot from the police station because they only took me on a warrant because I had somebody really amazing take that whole charge for me. I had to walk home from the police station barefoot without my daughter and I knew I had two options to either go home and do the biggest shot of dope that I had ever done and kill myself because I knew that I didn't have any control over where my baby was. But I had two other kids there and I didn't want them to wake up and find me dead. So I put everything into a box and I went out into the backyard and I was screaming so loud I just wanted to die because I didn't think that I would ever have one of my kids taken from me. And I burnt everything and I haven't looked back. I knew that it was time for me to fight like hell. I only lost her for four days because somehow it was the worst come down of my life because I knew I had to push water because I knew they were going to drug test me. And I passed it miraculously and they were like, oh well somebody else is claiming these drugs maybe she's not a drug addict. And they gave me back my daughter but it was the four longest days of my life and then they required a hair follicle test. And obviously I failed that but they said because I was sober at that time and they required treatment and all of these other things they were going to let all of my kids stay with me. And I worked all the steps that they asked me to do. They said they've never seen somebody get off court services in under a year. I got off court services in under nine months. My kids hadn't been to doctors in three years and I scheduled all their appointments, their dentist appointments, I got them up to date on their shots and I did this without it being court ordered. I took it in and I showed the judge that I was different, that I was a changed person, that I wanted to better myself and my children. They let us off court services. I've been off court services since January so we're coming up on a solid six months of, seven months of us being sober without having anybody watch us to show and prove that I can do it myself as well. I had a lot on my plate working 120 hours in a work week while managing four kids at home. My husband was very distant from me. He was using behind my back and I knew this and I tried to justify it like, okay, well, our sex life isn't the best usually. Whenever he uses, he comes home and he caters to me and so I would justify it in my mind but we slowly drifted more and more apart and I wanted to connect with him. I wanted to reconnect and he was the individual who was with me when I was 18. I'd been with him for so long that I couldn't not reconnect with him and so I reconnected with drugs. As I had done that, I found out that he was shooting on me behind my back with his ex-wife and it just sent me into a deeper, darker place of feeling like I had nobody and that my worth was not what it was. So it just became easier to use every day. I went from using maybe twice a week to using daily. I went from just snorting it to shooting it up in a matter of two weeks because I'm an all or nothing type of person. So I was in a really dark place and I was for three years. I couldn't pull myself out of it. I felt like a failure and like nothing I would do would ever make everything okay again. I've persevered and I've pushed forward and I've done it for myself but I did it for my kids because they needed to have somebody strong for them and they needed to have somebody there supporting them. I'm not proud of what my now nine-year-old had to do and play mommy to two younger siblings at age six. She could cook spaghetti. Who does that to their kid? Like because I was too lost in my world that making them dinner was the last thing on my mind. My kids witnessed severe abuse between me and my husband. Knockout dragouts. I remember him choking me out and my son on his back, you know, hitting him, telling him to leave me alone. My kids suffer now being in fight-or-flight mode constantly. They always yell, they always fight, they're always on edge. And you know, part of the growing stuff for me to know that I'm doing the right thing as a mother is to make sure that I get them in therapy and that we address these things because I can't just pretend like they didn't happen. They altered and damaged my children's frontal lobe and it's now my job to try to repair it because I'm the one who broke it and a mother should never break their child. I'm a firm believer now that if you put in the work and you show improvement, the courts aren't going to just take them and put them in the system. You have to put in the work if you want, rather that be if you've lost your kids or it be in your active addiction. You have to put in the work to have a different life and a different change. And I try to put that work in every single day of my life and it's not always for me. It's for those smiling faces I come home to to make sure that they're not in a toxic cycle and that they'll know that they have somebody they can depend on and lean on that is strong so that they never feel lost or broken again. You create a lot of wreckage and you create a lot of pain and you can't always fix that, especially when it's in something as small as a child who's trying to learn and develop how to live life. And I look at my kids every day as they go into their fight or flight mode and as they struggle, she's now five. She's having behavioral issues in school. She'll freak out. She destroys classrooms because that's what she saw. She saw her mom and dad destroy their home. She watched whenever somebody didn't get their way, it turned into throwing your feet and hitting and stomping. And when you look at them and they're that broken because of you, it brings back everything and it makes it hard to not go back out and use. It does. It doesn't mean that I've won every day yet. I fight every day to stay clean just because I feel like I've had these amazing victories doesn't mean that I'm not fighting for my life every day. And I think as people get further into their recovery, they forget that. One of the things that keeps me sober is going to my fellowship NA groups. I hadn't been to one in about a week and a half and I've been struggling and my job is drive from facility to facility. It was about 10.50 last night. And my meeting usually gets over at 11 and I was driving right by there and I pulled in and I stopped in and I walk in and it's a room full of people know me and they stopped in me and they're like Brooklyn. It made me feel great and I got to open up about some things with only 10 minutes left on the board, but that 10 minutes was everything to me. It takes a village and an army and as people get further in their recovery, they start to forget those things and they just go on with their life. Okay, I have work. Okay, I have this. Okay, the kids got this. And they stop going to their fellowship and they stop following the steps and that is the first way for you to fall back into addiction. And I look at my kids and I never want to put them through that again. No child should have to go through that. My five year old struggles every day. We can't even pass a cop and she'll be like, mommy is your seatbelt on mommy. It's she's terrified of them. I never meant to impact that fear on such a small child. She didn't deserve that. And I just want to be better for them.

t1QiZyvXO4Q,"I believe recovery is an ongoing process. However, I believe a lot of decisions lie on a person who's dealing, who's going through the recovery. How did the addiction begin? I've been talking about with COVID and losing my faith. Losing my faith in God because I wasn't healing as fast as I thought I should be. So with that dwindling of faith, became a dependency on something else, a dependency that was not as great as God, but it turned to drugs. How did it happen? I think more, I could call them friends at that time, but when I look back, they really weren't friends at all. And I think I was looking for something that would bring me some comfort. And the comfort that I had, I walked away, I turned my back away from it. And drugs became my comfort. Fortunately, I was able to see rock bottom. I was able to see that during that descent, I was slowly killing myself. And during that descent, in realizing that I was killing myself, I knew I didn't want to die. I knew I didn't want to die. But I also knew that there was a saving grace for me. And the issue was, the problem was, I didn't know how to turn back to it. I believe that because of my guilt, my shame, and my embarrassment to how I let drugs become a stronghold, a domination over the life that I was previously living, that saving grace was there, but my guilt and my embarrassment and my shame would not let me turn back to it to grab a hold. It was more that I was angry with myself than anything because I allowed myself to get to that point. And I knew that that wasn't a place where I needed to be. I just didn't know how to turn from it. So what changed? How did you get to that point where you could do that? Where you could turn it around? Well, honestly, I had someone reach out to me who truly had my best interest at heart and didn't want to see me in the place where I was. They reached out. They put words of positivity in my ear. And they didn't turn away from me. They didn't turn away. They didn't judge. They didn't point a finger. They showed me the way back to that saving grace without being guilty, without being ashamed, and without being embarrassed. And I needed that. I needed it. And I reached out and I grabbed a hold. And it turned out pretty good. They welcomed you? Yes. Not only did they, but God did as well. God was always waiting to welcome me. So you never found the judgment you feared. You never found that scrutiny? No, not once. Not once. Actually, it was more of a welcome to recognizing that love was waiting for me. Love was waiting for me. And that love was not just the love of God, but his saving grace and the ability to be loved back to life. Wow, that's kind of poetic. It's true. So where are you at now? How are you doing? How am I doing? Yeah. Oh my God. I'm doing very well. I'm doing very well. Yeah, that's not a good enough answer. Okay, well, I can, I'm too blessed to be stressed. And I'm in a much greater place than where I was. And I expect my place of, I expect my place to expand a great deal more. What did you feel like was rock bottom for you? The fact that no matter what I did, I needed, I felt like I needed to have drugs involved in order for me to function and live my life. So like everything else kind of falls by the wayside. Pretty much. And your whole mission is to use. The next use. Yes. The next fix, the next hide, whatever. Is there something I should have asked you that I have? Um, yeah, you should have asked how can the next person get to a place where I am? And I would tell you, let go of yourself, your desires, your fleshly desires, and let God. I mean, I guess maybe we are under God's guidance. I guess the issue would be is do we choose to follow that guidance? I chose to. And I'm grateful that I did. I wake up every morning now, giving God praise, thanking Him for my life. Thank you for His blessings. And now I go to work every day. And I thank Him for all of that. Being this transparent in my life right now, I thank God for it.",loaded_from_file,3998,Anthony's Story - Recovery and Faith,512.0,10,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00
td9QqJLWsuI,"So, growing up, I was well provided for, you know, my parents provided physically for me in all the ways, but they both did struggle with substance abuse. Being clean eight years, you know, I've kind of taken a really good hard look back at my life and tried to dig up pieces of where it began. I was a really good student in high school, had a mentality if you smoke cigarettes, I would not even talk to you. So, you know, we had speakers that came in that I never listened to because it was never going to be me. Well, I dove into athletics, I believe, because my parents were active in addiction and my home life was chaotic. But high school doesn't last forever. And I graduated high school, never really had a social circle. You know, I had a lot of things going for me individually. Was a good athlete, got accepted to college. But I didn't have any friends. Like, I was a loner all by myself whenever I first got out of high school. So, I think that I just kind of fell into a group that accepted me because I needed that connection that I was missing and started using marijuana and alcohol out of high school. Then I met my husband, didn't meet him, I actually went to high school with him. But he had just gotten out of prison, he was on probation. And so, he was doing really well. So my story doesn't start there, but my story starts when he got off of probation, off of papers because he was missing the accountability. And so, we started experimenting with different things together, starting with marijuana. We were living in a home that someone handed me a Percocet because of my back hurt and I was working two jobs and going to college. Then someone handed me some Adderall and it got me through the long days. But the time came whenever we moved out of that house, days come that you run out of those things. And I quickly learned what withdrawal felt like and that is when the street chase of drugs began. My husband had been an addict since he was 12 and so it was kind of what he knew, all he knew really. So we just, we started using opiates together. We got really, really heavy into opiates. And to the point that we had gotten our own place but our income was spent just on drugs. And so, eventually we had to move back in with his mother-in-law. And still using, eventually that landlord said, hey, they can't be here, there's too many people in the home. And so we ended up staying with my sister. Shortly after that I got pregnant with my son Carson, addicted to opiates at that time. And staying with my sister, I remember going into a prenatal visit and a caseworker came into my room and let me know, hey, we're aware you pop positive for opiates. Pretty much it has to stop at this point. And it did take me a few weeks. Lots of excuses, lots of all stop tomorrow. What if the baby goes through withdrawal? Just that classic attic thinking. But about two weeks, four weeks later I was able to stop using opiates altogether with him. Delivered him August of 2012. And then we had my brother-in-law who came and stayed with us who was using drugs that I had no idea about at that time. Delivered him, came home postpartum. He was using meth in my house. And I had always been really, really against that also. But postpartum, going through depression, no energy. And so that social pressure and seeing how energetic I guess everyone was I think is what led me to try it. And I was hooked. I mean from that point forward, two weeks after the delivery of my first son. Six months after him I got pregnant with my daughter Raelyn and was using meth at the time. And I didn't want to deal with the caseworker. So I just didn't go to the doctor. Received no prenatal care through that entire pregnancy. And thank God she's okay and thriving and incredible. But about eight months into that pregnancy I locked myself in the room essentially and slept my way through the withdrawal and was able to kind of pull a month of sobriety together. So I was able to take her home. Started using probably two or three days after I brought her home. So we have a newborn and a 14 month old at this time. Six months later I got pregnant with my third son Caleb. And I was not able to stop using drugs with him. Again, no prenatal care. Was afraid of that social worker. And I delivered him positive from meth in marijuana. And on day two of my hospital stay because I had a C-section, social services came in and took all three of my kids. Thought that would be my rock bottom. You would think that would be my rock bottom and that would be enough. But it wasn't. It did end up going a little bit deeper than that. But day two they took my children and for the next two weeks after that I slept post C-section on a friend's floor because we were homeless, jobless, carless, all of the things. Had our first court date and so we had a case plan with lots and lots of tasks which is, it was very intimidating just because lots of the things on these case plan goal tasks are things that we've never even done in our adult life. Because we've been using drugs since we were 19. So get a job, maintain employment, maintain housing, get a vehicle, maintain your insurance. Normal things for a normal person. But honestly we hadn't even really done those things because we were not very responsible in active addiction. So it was almost defeating. And so we were able to put like two months or so of clean time together. We were seeing our kids, we were getting office visits, things like that. And then we would fall back off kind of here and there, hit and miss. But my husband and I ended up splitting up for about six months in the beginning of our case. And I was able to pull six months together, gave up quickly when I realized that financially I'm not going to be able to do this or that was my thought process. When children are in care you're paying child support. I was a single mom making sticks at Golden Corral for 12, 50 an hour trying to get a house for my children to come home to, relocating, getting a vehicle. And in my mind I just couldn't fathom being able to do it on my own. So I gave up and went back to my husband. And we started using together. He told me you've come too far to come back this way and ruin everything that you've built. But I just stayed. Eventually we started using together again, led us to some darker paths. So started using IV, couldn't do it myself. So I was having others inject methamphetamine into my arm, which is another low that I never thought that I would ever experience. Staying in a trap house essentially. Everybody was using drugs. And I remember about 11 months into our case my mom called me and she said, actually they're going to relinquish your rights. You have court in 30 days. And we said we were done at that point of course. My husband left the house that we were staying at and I ended up using that day. He came back, was mad, very upset through a fit, ended up with a lot of pain. And he ended up leaving and walking to my father's house because he can turn this thing on in his brain and like hate something and like it can work for him. So codependency worked to our advantage that day because I followed him. I ended up staying with my dad's for a little bit. Getting some clean time together. Started our outpatient treatment. Started going to NA. Found our place in the rooms of narcotics anonymous and began our recovery journey. We both got clean on March 1st, 2016. And so we get to carry that special date with us. Let's see. It still took us about a year to bring our kids home. Just because I was honestly scared that I was going to fail. I was scared if the accountability was no longer there that in my mind it would be an excuse that I could maybe get away with it. And so it was a really scary time for me because I didn't want to fail. And I had wonderful case workers that talked me through that and let me know you're doing all the right things. You're doing everything you know these kids need to come home or sending them home. It was almost like take them back and it there was some pushback for me because of that fear. But they came home and in June of 2017 I actually ended up bearing my father to this disease. So I want to have been a lighter for two weeks. I had a six liver failure, had an infection and because of his past drug use his body wasn't strong enough to fight the infection. His birthday is March 1st. So I get to give something really cool to him every year on my clean day because it's his birthday. God works in my life today. I can't even explain in how many ways. But we brought our older two home and it did take us two years to do that. So my third son we actually elected to have him adopted by the foster family that took him in. Which was a hard choice but I don't regret it because I still feel that I did what was best for him. So I did bury my dad to this disease. It was right around Father's Day. And I had a childhood dream of becoming a nurse and I mean everybody knew that. That was what I wanted to be. I've known since like the second grade. And so I had one of my NA friends come out with me and we read him his father's state card and I promised him two things that I was going to stay clean and I was going to be a nurse like his little girl always said. So I was able to pay back some old school debts. Got my CNA, started working at a hospital, applied for LPN school, got accepted, became an LPN, started my career with Valley Hope of Atchison. So I'm now a substance abuse nurse on an inpatient treatment facility. After I got my LPN, God works my life. He said sit down have another baby, work through a surgery in early recovery, which was incredibly scary. Surgery, medical procedures for an addict are just so scary. But I had a wonderful doctor that I was able to be full and honest with and he respected my wishes. And so it was a beautiful thing, that pregnancy to just be able to take it all in and experience that because I didn't get to do that with, you know, the other children in a sense. So after I had Connor, he's now four. I did go to North Central and I bridged to my R and so I'm an admissions nurse at an inpatient drug and alcohol treatment facility. And currently in school to get my bachelor's of science in nursing, so that I can grow. My goal is more on a corporate level so that I can be a leader in helping addicts just throughout the continuum, because I love the company that I work for. And another thing, you know, addiction is a family disease. So I mean, my entire family struggled with addiction. And since it's sad that it took the death of my father, but something good that had come out of that is we saw, you know, what these drugs can really do to your body. And all four of us girls are now clean, have good careers. Two of us have went back to college. And so we're just living the life that he would have always dreamed. I mean, and if that's what it took him not being here in order to see his girls happy, I don't think he would have changed it. you you",loaded_from_file,11047,Ashley's Story - Helping Others,791.0,17,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00
te_KSAwmwQU,"Well, I have a twin sister. Her name is Heidi. And we grew up in your very kind of basic general middle class family. Not a lot of turmoil. No cussing and yelling. My grandfather was a minister. My grandmother raised us because my mom was so young when she had us that she was too young to take care of us. So my grandmother stepped in and took care of us. And so we were raised in this very normal, you know, atmosphere. And then my mom got us back at some point as we were a little bit older. And she remarried my dad. And then we moved in with him. And then that's kind of where some turmoil did start. My dad could be very physically overbearing at times and abusive. And so that they ended up separating when that was going on. And then it was just me and my sister and my mom, like through my whole teenage years. So it was like three sisters in a way, because my mom's only 15 years older than me. You know, so it was like we were raising each other. So we had a lot of fun then too. We were we were we were bad because my mom said something. We respected it. And that was it. But we did have a lot of freedom. And we matured very fast. And like I could, we were latchkey kids too, you know, where you kind of let yourself in, take care of yourself, feed yourself and all that. And then she'd come home and make dinner. And then there you go. And she she was in school. My mom's went into college. So she was not there a lot. She worked a lot and was in school. So it was just me and my sister and every friend in the neighborhood. We had kids constantly there. So it was always packed. And we were just we were wild. I'm glad that my daughter does not do half of the stuff that we did. Because oh, no, I know. I know her maturity level isn't the same as we we were, you know, we were we were pretty grown at 15, really. But then we ended up bouncing back and forth between Jacksonville and here. Because I would want I'd be with my mom for a while. And then I would get burned out. And I'd come back here and be with my grandmother. And then I would be with her get burned down from Scola, go back to Jacksonville. So kind of bounced a lot back and forth. And during my period in Jacksonville, I ended up dating a man named Russell and getting pregnant with my son, Matthew. And um, during that time, my mom and dad decided to get remarried after all these years. Yeah, which I was at the time was not happy about because I was used to being able to see my dad when I wanted to see my mom, you know, when I wanted and not have to see him to see her. So I wasn't happy about that. And but they did they got they've been married now for 26 years. So I guess it worked better with us out of the house. So they didn't have us to argue over anymore. They were married three times to each other. They tried their time was a charm for them, I guess the verse two didn't go so well. And that was because of my dad. And the way he he's not, you know, the way he was back then, he could be very physically abusive, which we weren't used to. We didn't get weapons, you know, and then all summer live on my dad and we're getting it wasn't good, you know, and I had my appendix ended up rupturing once. And I had had my appendix removed. And he says that that wasn't he didn't do that. But he did, you know, I had bruises. And I think I remember the police coming into the hospital, you know, looking looking at me and stuff. So but that was a long time ago, you know, and I didn't I held on to it for a long time. I held on to that for a very long time. And then I finally, you know, had to let it go. And I had to forgive him and move on. Because if I didn't, then it would just mess me up. So I was like, you know what, I let it go. And he's not he's not like that anymore. You know, he's one of these a better grandfather than he was a dad. So that's that's good, at least. I ended up moving back to Pensacola. And I brought of course, I have my son with me. And we were living at my grandmother's. And then I got a job at a club here in Pensacola. And got an apartment. And it was me and him, you know, and my grandmother kept him when I worked because I worked at night. So, you know, she'd taken to school in the mornings and I'd get him from school, bring him home. And during the time that I was working at the club, I ended up dating my daughter's dad. And we were together for probably like three years. And it was very up and down, like constant from the pretty much from the beginning. And for some reason, I just I would break it off. But he'd always come back, pull me right back in. And we ended up moving back to Jacksonville. And he got a job. So he went with me. And it went, it just got even worse once we got over there. And we ended up splitting up and he came back. But when he came back, I found out I was pregnant with my daughter. So I called and told him and he came back. And I shouldn't have let him come back, honestly. But I was like, you know what, I'm not with my son's dad. So I wanted to be with at least one of the fathers of my children. I didn't want to be that, you know, have another child, not even have him in the home. I wanted that two parent family for her. And it was horrible. It was not good. The whole pregnancy, it was just constant. And I had my daughter and he got a job back over here. So then we came back over here. Yeah. And then we're here and we get a home and everything is kind of working itself out. So I'm at a point where I'm thinking, okay, this is the relationship took this long to get kind of stable. Like six, seven years, six years it took to finally get to this place. But I saw how he was with her as a baby and it just made me see him in a different light, finally. And I thought it was going to just start progressively getting better, but it didn't. It just went right back, especially once he got over here. And he was, what is the word? He didn't know how to be monogamous, but I could never prove anything. So I was always to be made to feel like I was crazy that he wasn't doing this. He wasn't doing that. And I was like, one day I will catch you. One day I'll be able to prove it. And so we argued a lot and we drank a lot too. I drank a lot. When I saw him pull up, I'd make a drink, but I had to because I couldn't deal with him in a normal mind. And at one point I was so depressed and so down because of our relationship and how much we fought that I got down to like 98 pounds. I was anorexic. I was suicidal. I was on a lot of medication, like way overly medicated. I was on pain medication because of some medical issues that I had. I was on psychotics, anxiety meds, like everything you can think of. And it just was not good. And then I found I was pregnant again. And I was like, oh my God, Jesus, this is not happening. But I was like, okay, maybe this is good. And I winged myself off of a lot of the medication because I won't take stuff like that pregnant. I didn't do it with my son. I didn't do it with my daughter. I wasn't going to do it with this one. And like in my second trimester, I had a miscarriage, a bad one. And ended up hemorrhaging and like was in the hospital for three days. And while I'm in the hospital, he goes to the strip club with his friend. You know, I mean, this is the mind frame that this man had. He just, he didn't care about anybody other than himself or what he could get away with. And I got out of the hospital and I came home. And then it just got worse because at this point, he had made it to where he was just very mental. We could be very physical because I would get, we'd both be drunk and then he would be in my face. You know, it's like push your buttons, you know, the ones nose, your buttons. And then I'd end up hauling off and hitting him, you know, and I think I blacked his eye twice because he would be right here yelling at me. And then but a lot of his abuse was mental. He'd say stuff. And after I had the miscarriage, then he tried to make me feel like it was my fault. I did it, you know, because the stuff I take or what I took before, and it was because I wasn't healthy, you know, whatever. I wasn't healthy and I wasn't healthy physically to carry the baby. That's why I'm sure I miscarried when I got pregnant. Like I said, it was 98 pounds. So I couldn't be healthy. And but God knew what he was doing when that happened because he knew I did not need to have another baby with this man. It just was not, was not going to be good. But it was still like I had a postpartum after I had the after I had the miscarriage. And it was bad and it lasted a long time. And I just the only three, the only thing that kept me from doing it was my daughter. If it hadn't been for her, if it hadn't been for her, would have did it. For sure, would have did it because I just couldn't, I couldn't escape him because when I would leave, he would come back and get me, you know, and talk me back in, talk me back in. And it's funny when people say, why did you leave, you know, you left, why'd you come back? Why did why did you stay because of that mental, you know, game that he played? So I would come back. That's very anti-drug. Like my older sister, she was, she had an issue with cocaine and she'd come over and like leave it in my bathroom. I throw it away. I call her, he left her eight ball on my sink. Oh, I'm coming to get it. Don't worry about it. I don't flush it. You better go buy you some more. You know, I just was very, I just didn't, I had tried them all, but I didn't like it. This wasn't for me. I was a waste of money. I thought it was stupid. But at this point, when you get to such a mental low, you know, a friend of mine had some meth and I was like, I am not doing that. You look crazy over there at that bowl, whatever you're doing, I'm not doing that. Like, I don't even know how to do it. And she was, you know, she was like, just shut up and here, I'll do it for you. I was like, it was just me and her. So I was like, well, if I look crazy, nobody sees me, but her. And it was something that just went. And instantly I was like, okay, like all the pain that I was, I would feel all the things he would say, whatever it was, this is like all of a sudden, I didn't hear it. It was like, I went home and he was running his mouth where I'd been. What was I doing all this? And I just didn't hear it. And I looked at him and started laughing. I was like, shut up. Like, no, he didn't, he couldn't make me cry anymore. And he didn't like that because instead of crying, I would laugh at him. So I would, you know, I would get a little bit from her here and there, but it wasn't an issue. And that went on for almost a year, just here and there. And then it went from here and there to once a week, from once a week to every day, probably in a matter of about four months. And then I went from smoking it to shooting it. And as soon as that happened, in a six month time period, you know, everything just went boom. Because once you inject something, it's completely different. You no longer, you no longer going to do something halfway. You're going to, you're going to do it up here. You're not going to settle for just a little bit of a high. You're going to go all in. Once you've done it, there's no going back to smoking it or snorting it or anything. There's no way you can't. And then he found out about it or something. And it was my way out. And I ended up seeing somebody else. And during that time, my addiction got even worse because he was doing it just like I was, you know, so just everything slowly progressed. And then I left him and heard that he came in and just me right back into the house. It was the craziest thing, the way it happened. He just somehow, he brought me there and he wouldn't let me leave actually, really. He just, he wouldn't let me leave. So then I was kind of like active. He had me in the bedroom for like a month. And, but I was there again. And once my daughter saw me, I couldn't leave her, you know, I was like, okay, I'm here. So that went on for like six months. And then I caught him finally with his boss. And I was like, okay, gotcha. You know, I knew it. I told you when I caught you, that now would be it. And he was not having it. And at the time, I was actually on house arrest because in 2012, when I had the miscarriage, it was New Year's Eve and we went out and I wanted to go out to another bar. And he didn't want to because he'd been out a couple nights before and spent a bunch of money. So he was ready to go home. And I don't know what happened because I only had like two drinks at the bar. But I woke up in jail. And it was because he called the police. I had some kind of, I don't know, I think I had a mental break because I was on all that medication and maybe just the alcohol, I don't know, but I completely lost it and woke up in jail and ended up on five years probation because I ended up assaulting two police officers and all kinds of stuff. It was not good. But I was on house arrest at this point from violating and, you know, there's processes. Every time I violate, they do something else. So they put me on house arrest and I was in the process of trying to leave. And he told my probation officer that he didn't know where I was. So they violated me. And when they violated me, I went on like a nine day binge. I looked horrible. Oh my God, I look like my mug shot looked like a, I look like the Crip Keeper. It was horrible. I was like, oh my God, so I look like. But it was amazing because I was happy to be in jail because I knew being in jail, that I was finally free of him. You know what I mean? Like my family went in and got all my stuff out of the house and everything. And I didn't have to go back there. So it was done. That was it. And I was like, yes, good. I'm glad. And I violated again. And so when I went for the judge, he ordered me to rehab. And I was like, okay, I need that. Because at that point, I had been doing a lot of stuff. I was shooting up meth and basalts. Like I was, yeah, a lot. And at the point, and at that point, I mean, I was probably injecting a half a gram at least at a time, which is just quite a bit. You know, almost a whole. I've done a lot. And I was like, okay, I need to go. Let's do this. So I went to rehab and I was there for three months. And I got out and everything was great. And so it wasn't great anymore. You know, you go run into people. They shouldn't be around. And then it starts all over again. I avoided them for a while, but I had it in my head that, you know, those are my friends. You know, I can care about, I care about these people, you know, I can be around them. I'm not going to not be around them. I'm not doing it. But eventually you're going to do it. So, you know, that was a mistake. 2017, I was sick, bad sick, and I didn't know what was going on or why. And at this point, I had introduced heroin into the game. Yeah. And I kind of started to back off of the myth once I started doing heroin, because then it's like, oh, this is even better. It was like unicorn tears and fairy dust. So I was like, this is amazing. You know, nobody should feel this good. Nobody is. That's why people shouldn't do these things, because it's not normal to feel that good. And I didn't know what was going on, but I was sick. And finally, I just was like, I'm dying. I knew that if I didn't go to the hospital, like immediately, that I was going to be dead the next morning. So I went to the hospital, and I woke up and the ambulance were transferring me from one to the other. And when I get to the next one, I mean, it's like madness is going on, and I'm just trying to get what is going on, what's wrong with me. And finally, when they moved me to the CTU, I think, the cardiac critical care unit, they called all my family in, and they told me that I had endocarditis, which is a blood infection. You get around your heart from shooting up drugs. I had, I was septic, and the septus had gotten so bad that my organs were shutting down, and it was like, I actually made it to my brain. I'd had some mini strokes, I had hepatitis C, and something else. There was like five of them. And I was like, okay. And they're like, you need, and you need an open heart surgery, you need to have your aortic valve replaced. That's what it is. They said it's not working anymore. And they couldn't wait for the infection to die down, because I would be dead. So they had to do the surgery while I had the infection still in my heart. So I was signing wills and things with my children, because they didn't think I was gonna make it out of surgery. Had like an 80, 20 chance of living. And I made it through the surgery. I woke up and I was like, okay, I'm alive. And I was in the hospital for eight weeks, because I had to be on IV antibiotics. And I was on like five different antibiotics. I looked like a cyborg. I had so many IVs coming out of me. It was crazy. But I lived through that, and I have a mechanical heart valve now. Kind of sounds like a clock ticking. My husband can hear it, and he's like tick, tick, tick, tick. Sounds like a clock. But I got out of that. And I was sober. I was sober that time for like three months. Yeah, the hospital went to the Methodal Clinic, I was taking methadone. I was on such high painkillers, though, in the hospital from the surgery and everything that they didn't have time to wing me off of it when I left the hospital. So I had to go to the Methodal Clinic. And then I went around the wrong people and ended up missing, going to the Methodal Clinic for three days. And by then I was starting to get, you know, I was sick. As soon as I started getting sick from not having the methadone, then I went right back to heroin. I didn't really do meth anymore every once in a while, but it wasn't something that I pretty much blew my heart out within a year. You know, I mean, there's people that do these drugs for years and years and years. And it takes that long sometimes for that to, you know, have all that happen. But not me. I did it in a year. So I was like, I'm not doing that anymore. And I was lucky, I know that, you know, I never had any abscess or anything like that that people get, you know, from shooting up drugs, especially heroin. But it just takes over everything again. And so I just was out there doing my thing. You know, I got my drugs, I got high. I would do it at the house a lot, because I was home in my environment, you know, I didn't, I would go get it, but then I would come home. And then I would hang out with people. And I was really lucky because I don't know, I was pretty good at keeping the wolves away, you know, the men that like to prey on girls that are addicts and stuff like that. And I've seen a lot, you know, there's a lot of bad stuff that happens. And but they, I was, they didn't try me too much. I was like, no, not happening, you know, but then again, I think they do it to the ones they know they can, the ones that don't have families that really give a shit, you know, and I am surrounded by nothing but people that care about me, you know, that would come looking for me. I wouldn't disappear easy. So they didn't really mess with me too much. And I was over at this old man's house that we knew, me and my husband know, and my husband was there. We weren't married at the time, obviously, but I had already met him a couple of times. He didn't remember meeting me because he was always really high. But he, I didn't really care for him at first because he was, I thought he was an asshole, actually. He had this kind of, you know, kind of attitude about him and all this is like whatever. But I did always know this day he was very respectful of anyone, girl that he was with and always thought that's cool. Like I'm on that one day, you know what I mean? Because especially in that environment, because you see men with women and they'll be all over them. They don't care. He's around. They don't, you know, very disrespectful. They didn't give two shits about that woman. He was different, you know what I mean? With them. So I was like, I'm gonna find that one day. And so I'm over at my friend's house who was this old cross-dresser. And he just loved me to death. And I was, we were cool because I knew that I only hung out with people I knew I felt comfortable with. You know what I mean? And not to say he hasn't ever done anything slimy because I'm sure he has and I know he has, but he never did with me. So I was like, okay. But him and his brother were there. And I was like, okay. And, but I was like, no, because he's an asshole. But his brother was so sweet. Oh, he was so sweet. You know, he could be a shit. He could be a shit too. But he was so sweet. So I could, I would go to him, you know, and I'd be like, hey, you know, when I needed something, I'd be like, I need to get something out. And he'd be like, all right. And I'd be like, don't ask your brother because he's, you know, he's, and he's like, I got you. Okay. And he was dating this, this one girl at the time. And her name was Amanda. And she was cool. I liked her. And I went to go get some drugs from his brother at this house that they were staying at. And I actually did get some from him. And he shorted me. And I told his brother about it. And so he was like, I got you. I was like, see, he's such an ass. And he came into the dude's house. And I was at and him and her had broke up. And he was just a sad mess. He was not happy about it. And I was just like, whatever, because how I have that disdain for him, you know, and so he was so sad. And I was in Luke's room and I looked down the hallway and he's down here. And I'm like, oh, God, I couldn't feel bad for him. I was just like, you know, and then I noticed him smiling at me down the hall. And I was like, Oh, I know he's not flirting with me. I know he's not doing that. Because he was always so busy with me, you know, saying this. I was like, Oh, and he's wandering around the house. And he comes back in the bedroom, why am I there doing my makeup, you know, because people would get high. All they want to do is their makeup girls constantly in the mirror. It's crazy. It's all they want to do is do makeup. And he goes in there, he starts talking to me. And I'm like, okay, so, you know, I'm talking to him. And I saw a different side of him at this point. You know, I mean, he kind of had dropped the whole macho, whatever attitude that he had. So I got to see a different side of him. So we started talking and kind of hanging out. He would be over there at Luke's house. And I would say in a matter of within a week, we were like, that was it. We were right beside each other, like nonstop 24 hours a day, hooked at the hip. And I went from not really caring for him all that much to knowing that that's who it's probably going to spend the rest of my life with, like that, that quick. And then probably by the end of the second week, he had proposed. And I was like, okay, like easy, you know, and then of course we were very codependent, you know, on each other, we were very like, at this point, our dictions are running side by side, they're together. If I had it, he had it. If he had it, I had it. We were working together to make sure that we stayed well and, you know, didn't get sick and all that. We went to Virginia on the drug run. And while we were there, on the way out of town, to come back, we stopped and got married. So that happened all within a month of us being together and we were married by the time we came back here. We told people, nobody believed us, but I was like, we're married. I got it clean a couple of times. I went to rehab one, two, three times. And they didn't keep me clean. They didn't keep me clean. I went to jail. So we had, me and him had, you know, we were doing things to support our addiction, you know, we would steal from stores, things like that at this point. When it was just me, I could afford my habit on my own. But when there's two people doing it, you know, you start running out of money pretty quick. And we had been arrested. And so I went to jail and I was in jail for like seven months. And while I was in jail, he went back to jail. And when I got out, you know, the attic brain, I was like, okay, I knew I was fixing to get my daughter back into the house, not constantly, but I was going to be seeing her a lot more because I didn't see her very much for a couple of years. Because I was out there doing all that. And I was like, okay, so I got like three or four days to do what I want to do. And then I've got to get back to, you know, being sober. So I think I had was hanging out with this girl. And I think I had smoked a little bit. And that was my choice because at that point, I was like, I'm not going to do, I'm not going to inject anything into my body ever again. That's not going to happen. And I went to another friend's house and my head started hurting really bad, like bad migraine. And I didn't understand. I was like, God, this is like, I've never had a headache that bad. And I've had migraines before, but nothing like this. And I had gotten like a point of heroin from somebody. And I just like snorted a little bit. Like two days I made a point was crazy. I never had a point last thing that long, but that was not wanting to do much. I just wanted to get rid of the headache. And then it got so bad that I was like, I got to go home. You got to take me home. So he took me home. And it just kept like my brain felt like it was fixing to pop out of my head. It was during COVID. So I didn't want to go to the hospital because I was like, they don't treat migraines anymore really. And all these people are sick up there. And I was like, I'm like, going up there, I just want to get rid of my headache. So I called a friend of mine. And I actually asked him, I said, you know, I said, do they have any pain pills? Because I did not want, I just did not want to really, I didn't want to do heroin. Because that was, that was the one drug that really had me. And he's like, he doesn't have any pain pills. He only has heroin. And I was like, okay, Lee comes, he brings me the, he brings me the drugs. And he had given me some he already had in syringe. Plus what I purchased. And I went in the house. And I've never done an injection where I didn't know how much was in there. I've never done that because I was really safe about doing it. Even though it's what I was doing, I tried to be very careful because I didn't want to, I don't want to die. You know, I mean, I just wanted to be well. And so I'd been sober for seven months. So my system is back to normal person's tolerance. And there was probably, I would say probably at least a quarter of a gram of heroin in there. And I just couldn't think my head hurts so bad. And so I just did it. And when I did it, it's funny because people say, oh, they didn't know they were overdosing. And that I feel like that's such bullshit because I knew immediately, well, and good. I tried to open the door before I went down and I didn't make it because my door was locked. And I woke up in the hospital the next day and apparently, like six hours later, when my grandma got up, she tried to open the door and it was locked and she knocked and I wouldn't answer. So she called 911 and they had to take the air conditioner out of the window for the paramedic to come in. And then for whatever reason, the cop kicked the door down. I don't know why she just didn't unlock the door for him. But my grandma said she heard them say that I was non responsive and they took me to the hospital. Well, when I woke up in the hospital, I was violent. But I think they thought obviously that it was because they gave me Narcan, you know, and I was coming out of them. But the Narcan didn't do that to me because I wasn't physically dependent on it yet. You know, I mean, I did it, but I wasn't, you know, so it didn't make me all mad and crazy. But my head was hurting so bad still. So I'm telling them, look, I know I overdosed. Please, I don't want to hear your lectures right now. I get it. Bad me. I did something that you wouldn't do. But you don't understand how bad my head hurts. Well, some of my doctors came in from before. And if I'd been in the hospital a few times, because I kept septus doing drugs like that, I would get septic go to the hospital. So my infectious disease doctor came in and I looked at him and I was like, look, something's wrong. Something's wrong. My head is hurting so bad. And he said, okay, go order you a scan. And I'm like, okay, I just want to know what's going on. And they did the scan and then they came back and it was like, you had a stroke. I was like, okay. Now I know when my head was hurting so bad, you know, thank you. Now what do we do? So he was like, it was a pretty bad one. And I was like, okay, so I had to stay in the hospital. And I was on blood. I take blood thinners because of my heart. And they put the blood thinners, they took them from me because I had had the stroke if I blew a clot. And then they gave me back the blood thinners a couple days later, but it hadn't healed right yet. So I had a brain bleed and a hemorrhagic stroke. And so my nose was bleeding really bad at the hospital. And once again, I'm telling them my head is hurting, something's wrong. And they got another scan. And then that's what it was. He came in, the doctor was like, oh, I got bad news. What's that? He said, you had a brain bleed. You had a hemorrhagic stroke. You know, it's like, okay, what are we going to do about that? So they took me off the war for him for a few days. And then I was in the hospital that time for nine weeks from the two strokes. So when I got out of the hospital, I stayed sober because it scared the shit out of me. Honestly. The heroin didn't give me the stroke. The meth didn't give me the stroke. My INR was off, which is what, I'm sorry, how thin my blood is. And from being in jail, they didn't give me the proper dosage of my warfarin. So when I got out, my RNR dropped so low. So that's what made me throw the clot. But it didn't matter that it didn't have anything to do with the drugs. It had to do with the fact that at that point, I felt too scared to do anything. Like, I'm not going to have another chance. You know, I've lived through open heart surgery. Now I've had two major strokes. I've had some mini strokes like the next time. You know what I mean? I don't want to test the law. I'm not going to test fate or test the waters and go back in and go, oh, you know what I'm saying? So and it's funny because people look at me when I say like, I feel like the overdose saved my life, though, because I wouldn't have gone to the hospital. I would have sat at home and tried to self-medicate a stroke, not knowing it was a stroke. But because of that, I had to go to the hospital. Not saying it's a good thing. It's not, but it did force me to go. And I just, I just couldn't go back to it. I just wasn't going to do it again. And especially when I started, my daughter was there all the time. So I had her back and then she moved back in with me. And I had, I had earned everybody's trust again and my family, you know, and I was like, I'm not, I'm not going to do this again. And I had promised my kids that I was done and that that was it. And that was, I'm in it. And I told Rudy when he was in prison, that I wasn't going back this time. So if he got out again and went back to it, I wasn't going to follow him this time because I followed him the last time when he got out. I had been sober six months. And that six months, I had his brother sober. I took him with me. We went to St. Augustine to my parents' house. I show up on my door when my dad's standing there with the six foot five, you know, Russian looking at his brother looks like he did look like this tall Russian guy. And my dad was like, where are you? I'm like, it's Rudy's brother and we're here to get sober. You know, he got sober. He got a job. We did all of it. When Rudy got out of prison, I went back to be my husband. And he went right back to it. So I went right back to it. But this time I was like, I'm not going back. He'll be alone. And I told him, I wasn't playing. And he got out and went right back. And he tried to convince me for about a month that he wasn't doing it. But I know my husband. I've been around him a million times. I know when he's, I know when he's done something or not, you know, like I know. And he tried to convince me that I was crazy. I was like, I'm not crazy, but I couldn't find it. He hit it really well until he overdosed on my toilet. And then I had all the proof I needed. And I called the ambulance and they came and they had to get him out of the bathroom because I couldn't pull him out of the bathroom. Which upset me because I have given CPR to so many people, but I couldn't give it to him. The one person that I would really want to give it to. I'm not saying I didn't care about other people, but the one person I would want to save would be him. And I couldn't. So I had to call the ambulance and they came in and they knocked him in. He sat up and was like, what's going on? I'm okay. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. And I'm like, no, you're not. You feel good right now. But you weren't a minute ago when your head was purple. But it broke my heart because I had to make him leave at that point. It was if I didn't. Her dad would take her away from me. And if I didn't, I would have to leave with him. Because this is my grandmother's house. You know what I'm saying? If it was my house, I could have probably played it differently. I had no choice. So I had to make him leave. So he went to the hospital on a gurney and when he got out of the hospital, he came, all his stuff was packed on the front porch. And he left. And then I had to watch from a distance him spiral down, being homeless and with his legs. When that happened with his legs and he got the ulcers and I didn't realize how bad it was because I didn't see him very often. Because I didn't want to see him like that. I didn't want to see him like I see pictures every once in a while or something. And I would just be like, I didn't recognize him. And it hurt me too bad to see him like that. But I stayed sober. I was like, I'm not going back. No matter how hard it was, it was really hard for me not to follow him. It was really hard. I would see him from on occasion and I wouldn't want to leave him. I'd want to be there with him. But I couldn't. I had to leave. So it was really difficult. But the day he called me when he was laying in the ditch and he asked me what he should do. And I was like, go to the hospital again, go on the ambulance, go to the hospital. And he actually went because I've been trying to give him a go to the hospital for months. But he went and then he called me when they were releasing him. And he said, they're releasing me. I don't know. What do I do? Where do I go? He asked, should I go back to Luke's house? And I was like, absolutely not. Because if you go there, then you're going to go right back to it. Because the doctor at the hospital had put him on Suboxone. And I was like, that's amazing. First time, the doctor tried to help him get off of something. And he said they said they'd take him to the shelter. And I said, go to the shelter. And he went to the shelter. So I was like, at this point, I was like, as long as you're there, as long as you're sober, then I will be right there with you. You're my husband. And I love you. But as long as you're out there doing that, I can't be with you. But he continued, he continued to stay sober, even through everything, even after his brother died, which I thought was absolutely amazing. Because I don't know if I could say I would do it. I don't know if I could do it. But he did it. And I was so proud of him. I have been sober since, I say, September 18th of 2019. The day I went into jail is the day that I put my heart into being sober and staying in it. But some people say, oh, well, because of what I did, when I had the stroke, then that erases the eight months of my sobriety. And it's like, oh, you were in jail, so you had to be sober. No, I didn't. How much drugs come into jail? Sometimes you can get drugs easier in jail than you can on the street. So for the people that want to be politically correct, I guess March 28th of 2020. It worked for me. I know that everybody's sobriety is different. Everybody's recovery is different. What works for some don't work for others. Some people say you have to go to meetings all the time and be a part of, have a sponsor and all that. And that's wonderful. And I know that if that's what you need, then absolutely do that. My husband is my sponsor. He, you know, when I need to talk to somebody, I can talk to him because he gets it. He's been right there with me through at least 70% of my addiction. So, you know, and then I don't know, I wish there was like a little wand. You could wave to make things, you know, just be packaged great. But I don't know. Things work different for everybody. The line is being around my family and being around my kids because my son lives with me now too. He moved over here from Jacksonville. So, you know, and then now my husband's back in the house. So I have my entire family around me and it keeps me grounded. Without them, I definitely would probably be right back in the same spot.",loaded_from_file,37540,FENTANYL KILLS - Heather Koper - My Brother's Keeper - episode 254,3242.0,46,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00
tzA_jd1bJVA,"I want to share with you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to share because anything that anybody could get anything, anyway, it catches anybody. I want it there to be had. That's me and that's what I stand on. That's what I believe in. That's where I'm going to be for the rest of my days. I found my purpose and I believe that passing it forward and sharing so that maybe some of the hardships can be alleviated from someone or they could see an angle that I took. Anything that could maybe just make one day in their lives better from something that they maybe heard or seen from me. I'd like to say I was what you would call normal. As a kid, you know, until about seven and then things took a tragic turn for me. And I never seen that normality since that day for the next 38 years. It wasn't ever the same since that day. And that was the day that my mother died. And my father, he was an electrical engineer. My mother was a professional fighter term veterinarian. And she had a heart attack at 31 and died in front of me. And I had a little brother that was two. And after that, my dad being working at U.S. Steel, all the steel mill shut down right after my mother died. We lost his job and all the men in my family, everybody in that part of the state, all the men lost all their work. So they all had to, when the steel mill shut down, it was tragic. So he attended a seminar that brought us down to Florida. We were, you know, passed around from babysitter to babysitter while he was trying to work double and find work. So the comfort was gone at that point. And I had to watch for my little brother and tried to step up my game to help my dad with him. But a lot of things transpired. It only got worse from there. And, you know, he found another woman within a year of my mom dying. He remarried. I guess he was looking for somebody to help him with the kids. And he was looking for companionship. Maybe he just didn't do good alone. I was too young to know. But I do know that the lady he remarried didn't want kids, didn't like kids. And that was who I had to call my stepmother from the time they got married. Well, I reminded my dad of my mom a lot. So I guess I got the blunt of it. I don't know why his, her death had something to do with him starting to beat on me. And, you know, my little brother could do no wrong. But I was like, I guess an image of my mother. So he, he took it out on me a lot. And so did the stepmom. She started beating on us. And, you know, it just, it, it got, it was a rough few years while they were married in 1988 when they got married. And in 92, we found out that my dad had cancer from the steel mills from asbestos exposure. Well, I watched him for the next two years, dying in front of me. I literally watched this six foot three, 260 pound man. I, you know, the day he died, his heart was beating in his stomach. I could see it. Now he was 130 pounds. I'm holding him up, feeding him water because he had a laryngectomy. And he told me and my little brother, I was 14, he was nine. My little brother was nine. And he said, just promise me you two will stay together. And I'm like, yeah, dad, why would we not? You know, I'm just thinking that I didn't know then what I know now. Well, he died like that day. Him arms, he just rolled his head over and he died. Well, come to find out two weeks after he died, our stepmom said that she was going to, you know, clean the house out from all the hospice in it from all the medical stuff. And we were going to go stay with her parents for a week and she was going to get all the, get the house cleaned up, get the death out of it. And as she said, and, you know, we come back. Well, she took us downtown Fort Myers where we were living at the time. And she said, get all the, you know, my dad was building a house, a new house with property. You know, he was, he had big plans and, and, you know, this was all still in the works. Well, she was driving my dad's car. I remember she took us downtown and she said they're going to, I'm thinking, why are we clean? I'm thinking, why are we crossing this bridge? We don't have to get to their house. Apparently that's where they were going to meet us. Well, I took all the suitcases out my little brother. We took them all out. She's sitting in the driver's seat and she's like, with the door open, she's like, y'all get all the clothes to the trunk. You get all the bags out. I said, yeah, she said the door. She drove off. We were just standing there. My little brother's like, bro, what's happening? Like mom's dad, dad's dead. And she just drove off. And so it began. The day of adventure began. And I turned into his best friend, his dad, his brother, his everything. And I soon got involved in, I went to a friend of mine. I went to school with, right after that, we just like reached out to his mother. Well, I went there and we stayed a couple of days until I could really figure out what I just, you know, had happened and how I was going to wrap my head around this. Well, I knew I had to keep my brother in school. And then, you know, I knew then what he had meant about us staying together. He knew she wasn't going to keep us, but he didn't say it at the time. He knew she wasn't going to keep us and there was nothing he could do about it. I got to my friend's house with my little brother and they were all gang affiliated with the Latin Kings. I started following around and doing things to make money at night, you know, running around with that organization and doing things for money so that I would take my brother, who was in our old neighborhood where my friend, where we were at. And I would take him to different people's houses that went to his bus stop with their parents and I would go to him. I'd be like, you know, my son goes, my brother goes to school with your child. And this is in 1994. I'll give you $50 if you will just let him sleep on a pallet couch, whatever, and see him off on the school bus in the morning. And I did that every single night for months. And the things I was doing at night at 14 was not, it was really bad, really bad things. But I had had the heart or say lack of heart for it at that time. I had enough anger in me to where none of that fazed me and that's what I thought was scary. Some of the things I was subjected to doing didn't bother me. And, you know, I ended up getting shot when I was 15 three times in a drive-by. And it was, you know, it was, I found out who did it. I knew who did it, but it was like it wasn't the time or place to, you know, stuff happened. There was blowback on it. It was a lot of stuff. But I realized at that time that I was going to lose, you know, the ability to hide all this from my brother. So he started to know what was going on and they placed him in foster care because I started getting locked up juvenile. Well, one of the foster families tried to take him to Seattle, Washington and adopt him while I was in and out of programs. Well, he told him not to. He told him not to. And I was actually in jail at the time. He took his allowance, ran away with a loaf of bread and a jar of peanut butter and with his allowance, bought a Greyhound ticket and took a Greyhound bus all the way from Seattle, Washington back to Lee County, Florida and slept outside of the jail for three days till they released me. And I said, you're not going to separate us. I mean, when my dad said that, we took that to heart. And, you know, I learned later in life people told me that our father shouldn't have put that on us. But we took it seriously. And we stood by it. And, you know, things just started happening really bad. I was getting involved in a lot of bad things like organized crime and whatnot. And drugs was always a factor. Drugs was always a factor. You know, I mean, I, that was just part of it. It's like, I didn't even see that as a problem yet because the other stuff I had going on that I was doing day to day was so much worse than the drugs. The drugs was like, that was just there or what? And I didn't even know what a drug problem was at that time. Not so. We, we ended up coming to Pensacola through finding a somebody had found us on social media or something. And in Anabars and we came to Pensacola and said, you know, y'all get out of there and start fresh because we were down there tearing stuff up. Like my brother was being rebellious. He wasn't listening to nobody. He was fighting the foster parents. Like it was crazy. And, you know, she said, come up here to Pensacola and Yonka start over. Well, we thought that was cool. We found a family member, you know, because what we found out that at the time, you know, nobody in our family was there. Nobody in our family was able to take us, which was hard to swallow at the time, you know, but for whatever reasons, people go through things. Nobody was able to take us. So, I mean, there was a lot of, we came up here and to Pensacola and my, my aunt ended up taking my brother's social security money because it was in care. She, because he was a minor and she was keeping it. And he was not eating food like, like they know no food in the house. Like it was crazy. Like it was just, where's all this money going? You're getting every month in my, you know, my brother. So I said something when I came up there after him, he went first. When I got a job, I came up and, you know, because I said something, she kicked him out and then kicked me out. So we're on the streets of Pensacola. Well, I will tell you that, you know, I kept him away from the, the real heavy drugs for a long time because my greatest fear was for him to see or live half of the stuff that I had to go through to try to keep him somewhat normal. That was my goal. If I couldn't, I would be the fall guy. I'd do whatever just to make sure my, my brother did right. That's all I live, breathe everything, man. Because that was like, man, that was my way of feeling good is to watch him do okay. That's all I care. I didn't care about me. I never cared about me. I never liked me. I never, none of that. And it was, this was for a long time. I mean, this was most of my life. There was a lot of violent things. I mean, I had got stabbed the other years. I've, I got lung cancer a few years back. And, you know, eight weeks into it, I, of getting diagnosed with lung cancer, I went back to the hospital and they showed me in the biopsy, they showed me the big lump right connected to my rib cage. It was so rapid that it had, and aggressive that it ate one of my ribs away. And it was just sitting there, this big old mask. Eight weeks later, I go, and I mean, I did a lot of praying, of course you're going to do that, you know, and I'd had a relationship with God. You know, I don't know if I, I did it the right way, which I realized now there is no right way. But I always questioned myself if my salvation was real and this and that, you know, I, so I, I was skeptical, but I did a lot of praying. Eight weeks later when I went there, they ran the biopsy. Dr. El-Sahed ran the biopsy. He did another one. He ran it beside it. And he's, I want you to look at that. There's a big hole there when I'm missing rib. He's like, where'd it go? I said, you're the doctor. You tell me. He said, that's exactly my point. He said, he just pointed up and I said, you know, I don't know what else to say, man. I mean, that's what my father died from. My mother died from a heart attack. You know, my grandpa committed suicide. You know, it was all these different things, all these losses. Like I, like that's another thing. All our family was like, you know, besides we had a couple left, you know, a few left. Like I said, they weren't in a position to take us. So there was a lot of hatred for me growing up. A lot of hatred. My brother was always looking at me to make it right. And I was okay with that. I was okay with him looking for, because, you know, hey, I'm big bro. Remember, I'm the one that protects you. You know, I'm going to keep on doing this. Well, my drug addiction had gotten so bad at that point, you know, it went from speed and all that to over the years I went. I started doing heroin and then it became fentanyl, which that's, that's within the last eight years. You know, that started probably 2000 and I don't know what would that be 2016, 17. Um, I of course went through the pill mills and, and Dr. Shopping and going from state to state and going to, you know, filling up double scripts and taking people and all this stuff I was doing, you know, just to keep on going. And I think when I went into that life, it just kept going and kept going and kept going and I became comfortable in chaos. And the only thing that I would always resort back to is how good is my little brother doing. You know, I always, I always get so mad. Like he's like, well, how come you can do all these things and I can, you know, I just went through as much crap as you did. What's your, you know, we'd have them arguments and I'm like, bro, I'm just trying to protect you, man. I was like, well, who's going to protect you? I said, I don't know. I said, I don't know. I never could answer that for him. But there's a lot that, that, you know, it would take me a long, long time to go detail for detail because there was so much of it, so much, so much dark times. There, I mean, there was a couple of times I was sitting outside of my stepmom's house after she built that house and my dad died and she was living in it. That I had a gun with a silencer on it twice, two different times. And I was fixing to go in there looking at her through the window because I was like, because of what she did to us, she deserves to die. Because she's in there happy with all my dad's money, threw his kids on the street. She thinks it's all, you know, nah, I got something for her. I got a phone call both of them times and it wouldn't allow me to do it. It was crazy. It was the craziest thing. So that never happened. I mean, there was always miserable, like just bad things, man. And I just, but I knew inside of me that I was supposed to be something different. I knew that, that when I was born, he was born and we were running out of stairs to see Christmas presents that morning and just do things that kids, I was like, man, we were normal, man. We were normal kids one time. This world has, I mean, some of it was self induced, but it was for lack of knowledge to see anything else. I think like it was just what we, that's all we had took the path to be able to see. My biggest fear came through. I was doing heavy drugs and I remember the day that I found out my brother was doing heavy drugs. When I say heavy drugs, I mean opiates because that's the ones that are dropping people daily. That's the one where kids are parents are losing their kids, people's losing brothers, wives, husbands, you know, that's opiates is what's doing that. You know, I mean, I've heard one or two cases where cocaine's rupture of your heart, but I mean, there's hundreds of cases every day when it comes to fentanyl and heroin and all that. So I found out he was doing that. And I thought I died that day. I wanted to be dead. I felt like I had, I was defeated when all actuality. Who was I to think that this day wasn't going to come? He said, you know, many years, bro, I would sit and wait for that call about you. Every day you did that to me for years. And I know you want to what's best for me, but I never, you did so much trying to look out for me that I lost you. And I couldn't, I couldn't really handle that because when I say me and my brother was close, it was toxic. Like it was, there was nothing above or close to my relationship with him. Point to late period. That was all, I feel like that was all I had and it was, it was me and him all our lives. And then, you know, I ended up after I found out he was doing heavy drugs, you know, it really, it really knocked the, it really knocked the wind out of me. So he was to say I went darker and deeper. If you could go darker and deeper than sitting in a black room shooting fentanyl on your neck. I mean, I guess it could have got worse because, you know, it did get worse after that. My legs were supposed to be gone right now. I got from being in the streets, I and, and, and, you know, being on methamphetamines and fentanyl shots. So often for so many days straight, my legs will basically blew out for me the vascular part. I cut, I got, you know, infections in them and my valves were leaking and I was supposed to, I, they started like, they were getting better. They were eating away all the way to the arteries to where when I would wrap them up and I'd unwrap them and it pulled artery and I would almost, I almost bled out like two or three different times just sitting there with blood just shooting out of my legs. And, you know, where I would have to have the ambulance come give me, but the blood pressure cuff on my freaking leg to stop me from bleeding out on the way to the hospital. This was all from drug use and just being in the streets that hard. And my brother was doing fentanyl at that time as well. Well, I did catch a break in one of the drug houses I used to be in. I, and this is going to sound crazy. I met my wife. I met her in a drug house. I mean, that's what it was. And it wasn't planned, of course. It wasn't even planned that we was women. We knew each other was, but there was nothing other than that. And then, you know, I was making a drug run to, we were going to Virginia to take some stuff up there and bring some other drugs back. And, you know, me and her had been in conversation for a couple of weeks. And I guess you would say, Dave, well, we went, she went with me on that trip. We went there for a week. We came back married. I mean, when I tell that story, it's never, there's never a dull, you know, response to that one. But it happened. And I will tell you that I've went to prison for the third time since we've been married. I've overdosed. I don't know how many times she's had to separate me. It's because she got clean years before I did. And she, she stuck by me through that whole thing of waiting on my time. And the whole time I'm with my brother and we're both head in. So it's like she was, it's almost like when she married me, she married the both of us. And she knew that she's like, if I already know, I'm going to get him when I get you. You're like, I know you're not. I know, I know, I know how you and your mother are. So apparently that was exactly, was just enough for her. She had exactly enough for me to have some, a little, little bit of hope that just wouldn't let me take myself out or self-destruct. Because now I was watching my brother do it. And between her and my best friend, Brad Bishop, Brad had been in the picture with me over the years, but he, he had to go one way and I had to go the other because I was so indulged in the streets. And he was, he was there with me for a little while. And him and his brother Travis became like brothers to me and my brother. Big show was Brendan's name, but shows, whatever I call him. Let me rewind a little bit to, to back with Brad. My brother went to high school with him. And so I had met him not long after I moved to Pensacola and we, him and my brother were like best friends first. And then, you know, his little brother Travis was a little bit younger, but it was like, you know, we all were around each other. I was the older guy. I was the one who was able to get them in clubs by alcohol. I had, you know, I don't know, I was just able to do cool things that they thought were cool because I was the older guy. Like I'd take them strip clubs, whatever, have girls. It wouldn't matter. They, they thought I was what everything I did was cool even. So I thought that was cool. I was like, all right, even when I do dumb shit or they think I'm cool, you know, I was at, you know, I was that dude. I was like, you know, the cool guy. And really I was just a freaking idiot. But it was like he, one thing I will say about mine, his relationship is he's watched me go through some stuff. He's watched me. He said, I mean, there's been times when Brad would hit the street to come find me. He would come find me. Now he'd have an area, a clue area of the town I was in. But at this point, Brad was well established. He had, you know, we were grown now. And it was like, there was things when that, you know, I wouldn't have even expected him to do because I didn't think that those kind of friends in this world, you know, that those type of friends. Those type of friends were a thing of the past. You know, I didn't think that nobody's going to, what I call a best friend, that nobody's going to be able to make it to that stature because that was, you know, they just won't like that no more. Well, he was. He wasn't. And he was surprised me repeatedly because he never left my side. He never left my side through my addictions throughout the years. He never left my brother's side. He would have to distance himself at times because he could only get so close being how we were living, but he never removed himself. And to this day, that's what's priceless. I will say that I'm fortunate to this day to still have that best friend. And, you know, I'll speak about it in a few here, but that's, you know, now my partner in our organization. So it came, it came to a point where I was separated from my wife because she had to, because, you know, I overdosed in her house. I was selling drugs out of the house and it was a grandmother's house. So I'm in there selling dope, doing dope. Then, you know, I have two daughters and one of them lives in Panama City and one of them lives with me. And I will tell you, one of them was there when I overdosed in the bathroom of the house and she's seen him. She found me in the bathroom. So, you know, I know I'm a little bit all over the place, but what I'm coming to is there's been, that's all I've ever known is that is, is no sense. And if it made sense, I didn't understand it. If it didn't make sense, I understood it because that's, that's what it was. Nothing made sense in my life. And I was just freestyling. My brother was just freestyling. We were just trying to be there for each other until, until the good Lord took us away. Well, like I said, I was separated from my wife. I was in the streets. She had no choice. It was tough for her, but she had to let me go about my way. She never left me, but she had to fall back. You know, it's kind of like Brad did. You know, they, they never disappeared, but they had to, you know, had to fall back. Well, I decided one day when I was on the ground, I couldn't walk no more late. My legs were rotten off. I didn't have no more dough. I didn't have no more money. I guess I was pissing right beside myself, laying on the ground inside of a major highway by, by a restaurant in front of God and everybody. Just nothing in my name. My brother was clean at the time. My little bro, he had had his little spurts. He was doing good at this time. I, you know, at this point in time, after all these years, I'm just, I'm basically, you know, for lack of trying to make other people happy personally in my mind, I had already given up. I had already been like, you know, man, I'll live to make other people in my life happy because hell, that makes me happy just to see that. You know, it's kind of superficial, but it's really what I was, you know, moving on. And I really didn't care about me. I didn't ever like me. And I, but I wasn't worried about that. I was just trying to make it as long as I could because it did seem to me like this was all predestined. I decided that day that if I, if I laid there, I was going to die. So I called my wife and I said, what do I need to do? And she said, well, caught an ambulance. What are you talking about? If you don't lay there and die, well, I don't, I'd rather you not pick that option. I'd rather you pick the first option called ambulance. So I called ambulance. I've not been through this before. I know it's going to be horrific withdrawals. And I know that, you know, I'm not looking forward to that, but I'm also not looking forward to staying here and keep pissing myself. So I called ambulance. Well, I went through the withdrawals at the hospital. I called my brother. I said, I'm done. I'm done. Told my wife I'm done. Of course they're like, you know, we love you. You know, that's great. But I, I know the song and dance. I've told them this a hundred times, you know, let's appease him. Okay, babe, that's great. Just go ahead and go to the hospital. You know, it's just a matter of time, but they're going to hope for the best every time. I knew, I knew once and for all, I knew. I said, I'm not doing this no more. I'm leaving it all right here. I knew inside me, but I knew that it was nothing but what I could show because there was no more telling nobody. But I knew at that moment that it was over with. I just, you know, there was no need for me to try to prove it to anyone. I just had to live it. And this, and so it began. I went to the hospital. I got my legs looked at. They ended up, I ended up keeping my legs. I still have them. I walked here today. I, you know, but they're still healing. But what I did was after I left the hospital, they asked me where I wanted to take the Uber to, because, you know, when you get released, they give you a Uber. I said, well, send me to this program, the Waterford and Rescue Mission. I said, I've been there before. That's where I had when I had lung cancer. If I have a fighting chance of doing anything, I need to be around like-minded people. So I went there. I had to rebuild myself. And when I say rebuild myself, my brother started calling to check on me. My wife started calling to check on me. If I did, if they couldn't get ahold of me at all, it wasn't over a one-minute phone call. I mean, maybe once, I mean, I was in the hospital, I was in the hospital. I mean, maybe once that the whole time, but I wasn't really about talking to nobody. And it wasn't personal. It was personal. It wasn't personal. Then it was for me, because I had to really, really, really, really, from the ground up take this 43-year-old man and rebuild him and not even know what tools I needed to do it. But I had to start from the ground up from everything I knew, which was I knew I had never, I like to say domesticated. I've never been domesticated. I don't know how to function in a world day-to-day normal things. I don't know about that. So my brother was doing well. I was getting my legs tended to a waterfront. I started doing the medication I needed to medically assist in treatment. I started doing that. I started doing everything I needed to do. And before you know it, I was accumulating things and small things within myself. But those were the most important. I was redoing me. And this took months. I was there months before I really reached out to anybody. Brad, let's go to Brad Bishop. He was the one that was helping me stay there financially every month. He was paying for it. He started to come and check on me. And I just always think, man, I would break down. I'm like, why is this like, man, I really have a best friend. And I know what a best friend is. If you ever want to know what a best friend is, ask me. I'll show you one. And he started to tell me that Travis, his little brother, was getting out of rehab. And I say, he said, OK, so he's thinking that, you know, I'm starting to recover. Travis is getting out of rehab. We can link together. And, you know, it'd be a great thing. Well, we had to turn our phones in at the mission at night. So I had already turned my phone in for the night. And he texted me an after hour. So when I see these texts, it wasn't going to be until the next morning. So he texted me. And the next morning I look at the text messages. He's like, hey, bro, I know it's after hours. I know it's morning now, but we're going to get up with Travis. You're going to get with Travis today. He's out of rehab. We're going to link up together and get you all together so we can get some kind of yuck. We work together, man, to get you all game plan. And then the next text message right after that, it said, never mind, Travis is dead. When I read that, I was already very scared because I didn't know how to rebuild myself. And I realized it was on the same drug that I had just seen hell ten times over on. And, you know, he had got a pressed pill. He had got a Xanax, but it was pressed fentanyl. And he died. He died. And it really messed me up. It really messed me up because I was like, you know, it fueled me is what it really did. It messed me up. But one thing I will say is I instead of letting it pull me towards another thing to add to all this trauma, me and my brothers been through all our lives, one, oh, here's another thing. Instead of doing that, I used it as fuel. And that's what was different this time. So we, I got with Brad the next day, you know, of course, there was the grief and the sadness. Well, Brad, the plans on his surface service was for cremation. Well, at the time, Brad had had, you know, set it up to where there was going to be a viewing, because in his mind, he was like, you know, I want people to feel this. I know it might sound crazy. It might sound a little wild, but I want people to feel this. But I knew what angle he was coming from. I knew the anger. I knew the loss. I knew what he was getting at. So I said, bro, I agree. Well, there was a viewing and, you know, Brad being my best friend, Brad doesn't, Brad doesn't talk a lot. He's, he's, you know, he's quiet way more than you'll hear him talking. And at this time, there was no words coming out of his mouth. Like there's no emotion whatsoever. He was just like there. And that's, I mean, he showed no emotion. And I remember I went up to the casket with him and I just stood there and I was looking at his brother. He was looking at his brother and I just told myself, I said, I'm not going to look over or do I'm not going to do anything. I'm just going to stand beside him and let him know his best friend's there and I'm not going to walk away till he does. And that's exactly what I did until he turned to me. And right as we, right before we left, we, we, there was a small conversation. We got to do something about this where I remember the exact words or, or man, something's got to change or to those effects. And I said, yeah, yeah, yeah, you already know, bro, sign me up. You know how much of it has tore me. Yeah, like, let's do this. So that was the end of it right then, but the seed was planted. And right after that service, we had a conversation on the phone. That's exactly what we were going to do. We didn't know what it was, but we were going to do something. So me and him started making videos, him filming me about my story, this and that, you know, just fentanyl awareness fentanyl just. Anything I had to do with fentanyl and how horrific it was, we were trying to mention it, talk about it, mornings, whatever. We just, there was so much anger. It had really hit home then. And I mean, I had already seen hundreds of people die in front of me at these motels and all this. But this one really, this was a little bro. This was the youngest, like Travis, like he wasn't even, we all had done worse than he done. Like this, it was like, it's almost like it was personal. Like, so we started ideas about what if we start an organization and keep in mind, I'm recovering myself. I'm at the waterfront, but I mean, these thoughts are becoming, these are everyday conversations now between me and him. Well, that's when the word, the name offensive was born. Offensive, but we put it C in it for off fentanyl. Offensive, that name stuck. And he's like, that's who we are. And I said, yeah. The way me and him synced up, it was like, it all, it happened so smoothly that I knew that this was, at least on my part, I knew that this, I had always wanted to help people, but I was never in the life to do that. So I found out that helping people was something that really made me happy and it lined up with offensive. And we decided we were going to start something that had to do with awareness, to fentanyl. And before you know it, I started waking up liking who I was. I started telling my brother that. My brother, we had finally found a building to call our office for offensive and it was born. My brother had been over there. My little brother was coming over there. We told him about it. He said, you know, the last time I seen my little brother when he came to our office, he said, bro, he hugged me because my little brother's way bigger than me. He's like 6'6"", 300 pounds. He kissed me on the head, his arm around my neck and he said, bro, I finally got my big brother back once and for all. I know it's different this time, bro. I know you. And I knew outside of myself that how was anybody going to know it was different, he would have been the first one. And of course, my wife noticed the difference too. But those people, Brad, my wife and my brother, they knew. They knew at this time because I had put in a little bit of time. And you know, then the offensive thing took off. And I started to realize, I think God has just given me a way to find out how I'm going to make this person, this new Rudy. I'm going to do this. And I'm going to love every minute of it. And you know what? Five minutes months into that, Brad came in at two in the morning at the office and that's where I was staying at at the time. And he walked in. And I'm like, it's two in the morning, bro. What are you doing here? Like, you know, you live way across the bridge and what's going on? You didn't even call me. He said, big show is dead. I said, who? He said, your brother's dead. I said, I said, hold on. I said, you said my brother's dead. I must say that two in five times because it's just one of the things you don't want to hear. He said, yeah, he overdosed. It was his birthday. I had called my brother earlier that day and I got a text message from him. He said he'd call me later, but he didn't answer. I had a feeling then that someone wasn't right. He had already died. They had went to the hospital and a couple of our mutual friends were up there. And, you know, I hold a little bit of bitterness towards this situation, but I won't. I don't want anybody that hears this to think that it's them that I'm talking about. If anybody's listening that this pertains to that was there. But nobody would tell me because nobody, they were all scared to tell me because they didn't know what I'd do at that point. They didn't want to tell me over the phone because nobody would be able to be around me and they were afraid of what I was going to do because we've had prior conversations. My brother dies. I'm going right behind him. And if I die, he is too. We both agreed on that. Like, because we can't imagine life without the other one. We've lived off each other all our lives. So he was gone. He'd been dead about two hours at the time that they told me. And what's funny is there was hopes of him living during the overdose because the situation was his friend, best friend that he lived with, who is one of our friends from high school. He's like a brother to me as well. Zach Fri. He had, you know, he had had his girl film it because they filmed while it was happening. And I get it. You know, I get it. There's, it was with full intent that when he made it through the overdose, when he was, you know, come out of it, they're going to show it to him and tell him, look at this, Brendan, show. Look where you put us through. Look, look it out. Look at what you put us through. Your loved ones. How bad this is without the knowledge that he was going to die. So it was a video of him dying, essentially. And I have that video in my phone on people who beg me to get rid of it. I'll never do it. I actually, well, my brother would want me to do. There's certain times if I feel the right situation, I show it to somebody. If I think that they'll benefit it all from it. And I even use that any tool I have to do what I do now. And that is instead of giving up after my brother died and trying to take myself out like the whole world knew I was going to, I even knew myself. I was going to do it. There's a couple of times when I had the means to do it. And you know what? If it wasn't for those same people in my life, making their self so repetitively known to be that close to me, I would have done it. But they just wouldn't go away. And they just wouldn't stop telling me how much they love me. And they just wouldn't tell me how much my brother would not agree with that. And to help as many, and I do know that my brother would say help as many people out, bro, until you get where I'm at. Help those people out, bro. You got, you know, I'm doing it for the both of us. You're doing it for the both of us now. I'm okay now. I mean, because he was saved. I know he was saved. He had a great relationship with the Lord. But I also know he wasn't scared to die. And I'm not either. But I do know that God has put on to my heart to do what Brad and I form with this organization and how every day when I sit up in the morning, when I rub my eyes before my feet hit the ground, when I realize who I am in my life present day, I like myself now. I like myself now. And I've never liked myself. And that's my payday. I get paid before my feet even hit the ground every single day when I realize who I am, because there's not one person that can come to me. And I know that there's not one person that can come to me that is not able to come to me that I won't do what I can to help them. And anybody that, I mean, anybody that, you know, I know I'm very fortunate for being able to do this right now. And anybody that ever looks at me and here is listening to this right now. I mean, my life, I don't know how I'm here right now. I mean, I do, but I don't. I would have never have guessed that I would be here right now because I question myself still. But I really like myself. And I don't know if anybody's had problems with that, liking you and caring about yourself, but I've never been able to do that. And especially after my brother's dead to be able to say I care about myself, I was for sure that was going to be the one that pulled the plug. No brainer. But I don't even care about money. I don't care about money. I know I got to make a living to provide for a family. But when I say that, I mean that I love what I do so much, passing it forward that I don't care about making a dollar. My payment is in helping other people. And from all the bitterness I've ever been exposed through to still have the heart. That's really who I was the whole time. I was just never, I never had the chance to figure it out. So thank God to Brad and my wonderful wife, Heather and my family and my daughters ran on Ireland and my son, Matthew. I'm able to breathe and go to another day, man. I'm able to just wake up every day with a purpose, man. And offensive is growing so much like it took a while. I would say it was a slow burn at times, but there was a difference because we were doing everything we do from the heart. Like I'm not saying that anybody does it, but there's always different angles. But I knew that, you know, to go out there every day and just do it because it really hit home to you from the tragedies of addiction in this world that you just, when I see these women out here that just don't have resources. And I just see problems of the world and I'm nobody special, but at the same time, people tell me that they're happy to meet me and they've heard about me. And I'm like, man, what do you mean? Like it's still hard for me to understand that, except for what it is because I'm just, I'm always going to be humble. And I just, I want to, wherever I'm at, whatever neighborhood I'm in, if I'm around you anywhere in this world, I'm going to try to make the world a better place. And I'm going to try to be good to you and just because I know what the world can throw at you. I know what the world can throw at you. So I'm not going to make it any more of a problem. I want to be part of the solution, no matter what it is, man. That's where I'm at with it. And today my legs are healing and I'm, I like to say I'm getting stronger every day. I get to keep both our brothers' names alive by what we do at Offensive and all the other ones who have lost loved ones. We get to speak on them every day, them families, them people's children. Like that's the people that didn't, they never got a shot that we live through. And what you do is so awesome to give people like me an opportunity to be heard. And I just, every day is a blessing to me, no matter how it starts or how it ends. It's another day for opportunity. Thank you.

VFJGMQSCTcE,"I'm going to start with you. My story actually started down in Texas. I moved there when I was a little girl with my mom and her boyfriend. He had abscounded from probation, which he was on probation for vehicular manslaughter. So their answer was to jump states and start over down there. We got there and he was abusive towards my mom. He broke her jaw one day when he was on heroin. And of course as a little girl, I wasn't familiar with the substance use in the home, but I was familiar with the abuse. And so I grew up like that for a little while. My mom did eventually leave him and started working for a major liquor distributor in Texas who the owner kind of took us under his wing and took care of my mom and I. And so what that meant is I had full access to liquor all the time. I grew up playing in the owner's office where he had a fully stocked bar. And so on Saturday mornings, I'd watch Smurfs and pretend like I was a bartender or just run the warehouse and do whatever I wanted. At home, mom had a fully stocked cabinet full of alcohol. And one night when she was out doing something for work, I had convinced my babysitter to let me get into that fully stocked cabinet. I was eight years old and had my first blackout as a result of that. And then later on, I tried cocaine for the first time when I was 12. That was a situation where we had moved back to Kansas, but we were going to Texas almost every weekend visiting my mom's boyfriend at the time. And mom had gone to bed and he introduced me to the cocaine, but he had a hidden agenda. So thankfully by the grace of my higher power, he was not able to fulfill that agenda. After I froze and I was able to get up and go get in bed with my mom. But that was the start of what unleashed my anger because leading up to that point, we moved a lot. When we lived in Texas, we lived there six or seven years and we moved 11 or 12 times. So just when I would get comfortable or get friends or anything like that, we were uprooted and moving. And I lived in an environment at home where it wasn't the healthiest environment, obviously. So at the point that the boyfriend introduced me to the cocaine, we came back to Kansas and it was reported back to my mom in a different way than how it happened. And so I was in trouble and it unleashed my anger. And from that point on, I just acted out, acted out a rebellion, acted out of hurt and pain basically. But I didn't know how to put the words on it at the time. So instead, I continued to rebel by skipping school, hanging out with boys, having sex at an early age, all that stuff that comes with the territory of addiction. That led me to ending up in foster care. And so at the age of 15, I was in temporary custody of the state of Kansas. My parents still had an opportunity to let me come home. And so they were actually privately placing me in group homes while the state was looking in. But I hadn't dealt with that anger and I was continuing to use more often. At that point, it was alcohol primarily, but I was going to drink just as much as you were, if not more, right? Because I was angry and I was going to prove to you that I could do what you were doing, no matter who you were. And so that continued for a while. I ended up in treatment at 15, got kicked out of treatment because of my anger. I played softball and I was really good at it. And I threw an apple at a girl's head and it splattered on the wall so I couldn't stay. But eventually they let me come back. And when I came back, I still had the rebellious spirit and a lot of the anger, but I was surrounded by staff who they knew how to approach that. They were loving, they were gentle, they were kind. So they challenged me to memorize the 12 steps of recovery. And I did. I was more than willing to take that challenge because I'm also very competitive. So I memorized the 12 steps. I didn't realize seeds were being planted, but they were. When I got out of that second treatment episode, I was put into full custody of the state of Kansas. At that point, I had to go into a group home long term. And despite my efforts of running away from the previous group homes and getting removed, this time it was different because I was all in full custody of the state. And so I had to face the situation. I had to face myself eventually. It took me about six months to get there. Fighting the staff, you know, really acting out at this point. Jipping school, not being where it's supposed to be, all that stuff. But the state put me in Prairie View, which is a local mental health hospital here in Kansas. And I had to stay there for about six months. I had to go to school there. I had to do everything there. Couldn't leave the campus. And that was the point that I had to face myself. And I had to start working on acceptance. You know, even though I didn't want to be here and I did everything I could to get out of this, the only way to get out of it was to go through it. Right. And so for some reason I was able to realize that and settle down just enough to do what I needed to do to get through high school and get through that experience in the group home. So in 93, I graduated high school, graduated from the group home. I had a full scholarship for softball at Kansas Newman College here in town. And I was ready to go. You know, I had a bright future ahead of me, but I had a whole summer to get through as well. And I had to leave the group home because I graduated. So I went back home and home was okay. But my parents had got my mom had gotten married. So it was her and my stepdad. And he's a Shriner. And so he did a lot of shrine things. And there was a lot of drinking involved at those things. Well, as they, as I was doing the healing and what I needed to do at the group home, they went on with life. And so me going back home was very awkward and uncomfortable at times. At that point, you know, I'm not 18 yet. I'm almost 18. And I had done some healing, but I didn't have a lot of emotion regulation. And so instead of dealing with the feelings, I did what I knew how to do. I'd met some gang members when I was in foster care. I looked them up and I started hanging out with them when I turned 18. And so from 18 to 20, instead of going to college and utilizing that scholarship, I went to college and got kicked out for my attitude, my rebellion. And started running the streets. Now, at age 20, I did end up getting into some legal trouble, got some legal charges and got put on probation. I was looking at prison, but again, my higher power stepped in and that was not the plan for me. Instead, I got put on probation. And I ended up having a PO who, she was a hard ass. She drove me, but she knew exactly what I needed and I will forever be grateful for her. And once I started doing what I needed to be doing to become a productive member of society, then she became a supporter. Right? I mean, she was a supporter all along, but it was known at this point. She was supporting me. And I needed that and it felt good to have that. And so it was very encouraging. And so I started going back to school, started doing things to get my stuff together. I got put back into treatment, even though I wasn't using at this point because of my history, I had to go back to treatment. And again, that was another divine intervention for me because I ended up going to a outpatient program owned by a husband and wife here in town. And again, they were very encouraging. And so things were being lined up at that point in time that I needed to not go back and do what I'd always done. So I started off in school to become a paramedic. My goal was to be a paramedic, get my R in and go that route. I ended up getting pregnant and I couldn't figure out how I was going to work in a paramedic schedule with a newborn child. So I was already contemplating what I wanted to do. But when I was at school one day for EMT class, I sat down on break and there was a flyer beside me. And it was a brand new addiction program being started. And this is like in the late 90s. So anyhow, just seeing that flyer and how I felt instantly, I knew I needed to switch gears. And so when I left school and I went home that day, I stopped at a local treatment center and I walked in and said, I want a job. I don't know where I don't know what I'd be doing, but I want a job here. This is where I need to be. And then I went to school and I switched. I got enrolled in the addictions program and I felt like I was at home. I just knew it's where I belonged. At this point, I wasn't really working a program of recovery. When I, the father of my child wanted me to choose between them or those people that go to meetings. And so I started my career in the addictions field, not going to meetings, not plugged into the community, not doing any of that stuff, because I chose my family. And I was young. And that's just the decision I made back then. The father of my child ended up getting shot the first year we were married. He was working in rent to own and he got robbed and he got shot. He survived, but that started a series of surgeries and disabilities and situations like that that we had to deal with. So the point of that is that, you know, for the longest time I stayed sober. I stayed dry, if you will, working in the treatment world. And I figured because I worked in the field and I talked about it all day long, it was okay. I didn't need to do all that stuff at home. You know, and at home I had a lot going on, a lot of distractions happening. And so it was just, it made it easy to make that decision at that point in my life. But what was happening was I could just feel like my soul drying up. You know, my soul wasn't being fed. There wasn't enough. And I was miserable. I was just completely miserable. So I made a few efforts to try to go to meetings through the years that I was married that first time. But it always ended up in a fight. And so I always chose to just say, forget it and stay home. Again, I work in the field. It'll be all right. Well, he ended up developing a narcotic addiction from all the pain meds and stuff. And it was a very volatile marriage. So we divorced after about 12 years, three kids later. I kept the house, the minivan and the kids. And then he went off and did his thing. And that sickness, that being sick and tired of being sick and tired, that emotional bottom just kept coming to the surface. And for about six months, I couldn't get up off the couch other than to go to work because I knew I had to pay the bills and to take care of the kids stuff. But when it came to taking care of me, I just laid on the couch, feeling sorry for myself. Depressed. I had, I met a friend at one of my son's football practices. She was a party animal. That girl was going out every night and on plenty of fish and doing all these things. Well, I didn't want to do all that, but I was living vicariously through her. So I'd go hang out and, you know, and check out and listen to her adventures from the night before and all these things. She was finally able to get me up off the couch doing that. But because of who I chose to surround myself with, somebody who was an active, who was actively using, you know, eventually I did give in and I started drinking again. It took about three times of going out, three times of drinking that year to realize and remind myself of who I am. My name's Heather and I'm an addict, right? And even though I want to drink, one is too many and a thousand is never enough is very true for me. I will tell you, I'm going to go to the bar and be done at 11 and then three o'clock you're dragging me out of Denny's parking lot. Right? I am that person. So I made the decision to start going back to meetings about a year into my divorce. It was a messy divorce anyways. He didn't want it. Took about two years to get it. We had to go to two rounds of mediation to get to that point because he fought everything. And so I started going to meetings to quit drinking, but I also continued to go to meetings because of the emotional support and the love and the encouragement that I was getting because I desperately needed that at that point in my life too. And the more I went to meetings, the more I got involved. I started leading meetings. I started hanging out with people outside of the meeting halls. My life became a lot better and it came to life. Like I was surviving before that, but when I got involved with recovery, my life began to have a life of its own and it felt really good. And so at this point, I was now working in foster care. I decided to step back from the addictions field and go into a life skills position. And that was a really cool experience that kept motivating me to keep doing what I was doing. I ended up replacing one of my old counselors from the treatment center. I ran into an old case manager I had at a group home I was in, but this time I was working with these folks and building a different kind of relationship with them, which gave me a whole different level of motivation. It was very inspiring and fulfilling enough so that I returned to school and pursued my bachelors in social work. And then eventually I went on to get my masters in social work. And currently I'm working on my clinical license in social work, which is something I never, ever thought I wanted to do or whatever do. Noted I think I was qualified to do. But because of my friendships and the fellowship that I found in recovery, I was able to become or get to a point where I could believe that. Not only believe it, but actually sample it and try it and then eventually know that, you know what, I can do these things, right? I can't do them alone, but I can do them with the love and the support that I have found in recovery, which was very strong. Currently I'm remarried. I found my partner in recovery. He had been sober for about five years, or I'm sorry, six years. I stopped going to meetings a few years ago after we got married. We got married, we were doing the honeymoon bliss thing and everything was great and good. And then my eldest child developed an addiction to narcotics. And so there's been a lot happened with that. And again, my patterns haven't changed. The busier I get, the more distracted I get. And the more I take my focus off of where it needs to be, which is on me and my recovery. So these last few years I had been kind of dry again. This year I've been slowly making my way back, starting to go to meetings again. You know, I plugged in with some friends that are helping me get my clinical license that are like-minded, not just in recovery, but in career and in life in general. And currently I'm trying to make sure that I maintain those things. Because I know from firsthand experience, if I get unplugged, I just get miserable. But if I'm plugged in, the sky's the limit, right? If we just stick with it, there's no telling where we can go from here. So that's my story in a nutshell. It doesn't matter whether you want this or not. If you know that you need it, just start where you're at and go get it. If you want it, again, just start where you're at. I mean, there's no right way, there's no wrong way to get started. Right? The only requirement is the desire to stop using for the 12-step program. And if the 12-step program isn't for you, guess what? We have harm reduction. And I'm a big proponent of that. I know that that contradicts and there's still controversy with some 12-step believers. And that's okay. They have the right to hold their beliefs. But I know that at the rate we're losing people today, I can't afford to hold on to those old beliefs when I work with people. And so just start where you're at. If you want to go to meetings and still smoke weed, go to meetings and smoke weed. Right? If you're not ready to quit using completely, entirely, but you know something's got to change and you've heard that going to a 12-step meeting can be inspiring, go anyways. And don't worry about the naysayers, right? Because they're only doing what they know how to do. Okay? And there's a lot of people in the rooms who haven't yet come to understand. You might be an expert on your recovery, but that doesn't make you an expert on mine or somebody else's, right? And when we try to act like we are the expert, or it's only this way or that way, that's part of why we're losing people. So that's my answer is start where you're at.

vMAXWyrC8nM,"I'm here to tell the story of my nephew and tell my recovery story so that maybe it'll help people because I've come a long, long way and it's amazing. He was born on his mother's 19th birthday. To say Rikki had a hard life would be an inner statement. He grew up around addiction. His mom and dad partied all the time and he was raised by his grandparents mostly and he had uncles that were around the same age as him and they were showing him dirty magazines and smoking weed with him when he was just six years old. His home life wasn't all that great. Every time the rent would come due his mom and his parents would move him with his grandparents until they had enough money to rent another house. About nine or ten years old, when Rikki was about nine or ten years old, his mom and dad got a divorce and his dad dropped out of his life. He now never came back more or less and his mom did too for a couple of years. She went to work and never came back one day. When she finally did kind of get her stuff together, he and his sister moved back in with her. He started during meth when he was 14 years old and his mom didn't know what to do with him so she put him in group home after group home. From there he went to Stinson prison and a lot of jail time in Green County. You know Rikki, he tried so hard to better his life. He wanted better life when he was in prison but when he got out he was always drawn to the drugs and to people, his old friends. The last time he got out of prison was February 12th of 2021 and we buried him six months later exactly to the day. He was doing really good. He was deep in his Bible studies and everything. He got a job and went back to town. His parents, his mom and dad live in the country. He went back to town for his job and he met a girl. He was at their house and she offered him meth and he went in the bathroom to do it and had fentanyl in it and killed him. They heard his phone ringing and ringing and ringing and they didn't go in there and check on him. They just let him sit in there and die. My brother called me and told me. I was devastated. Me and him were pretty close and we also, sometimes I do feel bad about, we did do drugs together too. The fondest memory I have of him is down at Easter Sunday. Right before he died he said, Grace, at the dinner table and stuff. I was like, wow, maybe he really has changed his ways. He was a really good person. He had the most beautiful smile. His parents weren't very good to him. He was bullied by his family and his close friends for being, he would have weighed like 300 pounds when he was like 10 or 11 years old. He was a big boy and he started doing the meth and he lost weight and he got more confidence. He had all the girlfriends that were drug people. He just had a hard time getting away from it all. He did. He did the last six months he was out. He got away from it. He lived with his parents, with his mom and his stepdad, which is my brother. He was doing pretty good there for a while and then he just came to down for work and that was it. That was it for him. I didn't ever do fentanyl but I'm very familiar with it because my son was a fentanyl addict. He got out of prison in 2023, I believe. It was I think January 2023 and he immediately started doing it when he got out and he was living with me and I was finding baggies and needles and stuff in my bathroom. I talked to him about it and I called his PO about it too. That was probably not the right thing to do. I called his PO and that still didn't do anything. I found more needles in the bathroom. He was real careless about it. If you didn't want me to know about it, he was real careless. I took him over to talk to John Streep over at Freeway Industries and then he was okay after that. He's doing really good now. He's got a job as a meat cutter over at Cache Avers. He goes to work every day over time. Takes care of his mom. He does real good with me now, really close. My son had a little dog. I got a little puppy for him and I'm thinking that maybe if he had something to take care of him and be responsible for it, maybe he would change. That didn't help him and I went over to his house one day and he was just taking her around with him, doing his wheeling and dealing and I took her away from him. He brought her home with me and I think that's his motivation too, is her. Because he loves it. He loves that little dog. I grew up in a normal family home. My mom with parents, a couple of brothers, had a real good childhood and around the age of 13 I started drinking alcohol, smoking weed. The crowd I was around, I thought it was cool. They thought it was cool. I had my oldest son when I was 14 and then went on to have two other sons. My addiction really started after my brother, a different brother. He passed away from fentanyl patches, poisoning all over his body. He put him all over his body and he had a bunch of meth and killed himself. He was in the desert in California. From then on I started using meth real heavy in my late 30s. Most of the time I lived with my mom. My high self, I was taking advantage of her, not paying her any rent, not helping her pay with any bills and helping her clean, taking her car to whatever trap house I was going to and shooting dope in her bathroom. She got sick. She had a stroke. I asked God, I said, God you're going to take this addiction from me because I have a responsibility now I have to take care of my mother. He took away everything. He took away the memories, the cravings. Just one day, boom, it was gone. Now I own my own home and I pay payments on my first car. I want my first car on payments and I have a job taking care of the developmental disabled people, like Down syndrome. I feel like that's my calling from God. I mean, I've been doing it for many years and I love it. I went from living with my mom, being a needle junkie for 21 years to being, well I've been clean for four years now, but from going from that and running the streets, hanging out in trap houses to what I am now, I did it mostly for me, but to set an example for my children, you know, that it's possible you can change. I tried to set an example for Ricky too, but my youngest son smokes weed, but you know, and my middle son, he was in the army and he just recently got saved and gave his life to Christ and he works with me, taking care of the people I take care of. So he used to be an alcoholic and he's been clean for a couple of years now. But I'm just saying, you know, if people out there don't think that there's hope and that they can change, there is, there's hope out there.

w1eNSTRdzGw,"I had a lot going on due to drugs. I got addicted to drugs after I got into a car accident. And it took my brother and my mom away from me. So I got some good days, some bad days, but I tried to just take it one day at a time. I was a pretty good kid until the car accident. I played sports. I really wasn't in the streets. I stayed out the streets. I was a good kid. I got adopted whenever I was eight by a military man. So I really had no excuse to do drugs. But I guess just starting hanging out with the wrong people. And one thing led to another. And yeah. But before my car accident, I didn't do drugs. I always told myself I wouldn't be the kid to do drugs. Because my birth parents did drugs. My mom and dad. So I always looked down on it. And I always tried to stay away from the kids that they get high. Or people that they get high. Because I didn't like it. I despised it. Oh, I lost myself during the car accident. Because I had a lot going. I played sports. I wanted to follow in my adopted dad's footsteps. Well, he's my dad. That's who I called dad. But I wanted to follow in his footsteps. Because he showed me what being a man was. So that's what I wanted to do. And then they told me after the car accident, you can't do that. So I felt like, oh, my dreams were come. And then I just started hanging out with the wrong crowd. Started selling drugs. And hanging out with people that did drugs. Because I let people influence me to think I was cool. So then I started making money. I always had girls around making money. So I always thought it was cool. And then I was making money, making money, doing good. And then, boom, my brother was gone. And then it just made me start hating drugs. And then the more I started hating it, the more I started doing them. Which I don't understand. But I've been doing good for eight months now. I take a sub-locate shot every month, just keeping from doing drugs. But I just started taking it one day at a time, for real. I was clean for a year and a half, doing really good. Drug court, I had to keep my distance from my brother. Because I had to love him from a distance. I couldn't be with him every day because he was getting high. He didn't even want me to get high with him. And I just couldn't do that. So whenever I did get the call, he died. I took a lot of the blame because I wasn't there when he wanted me to be. I thought as long as I had people hyping me up, hanging around the wrong crowds, doing the most stupid shit that I could think of at the times, then let people hype me up to let me think that I was being tamed from the streets. I didn't come from the streets. I'm not the streets. I didn't need to be there. But I let people think that I needed to be there. I let people influence me to think I needed to be somewhere that I didn't need to be. That's what started spiraling out of control. Because I let people influence me. But now, I don't be doing that. I don't hang out with nobody. You do drugs. I don't hang out with you. I don't care if you smoke weed. But if you do all that hardcore stuff, I won't hang out with you. I refuse to hang out with people that do that kind of stuff no more. I turn my life to Jesus Christ. He'll help me out so much. If people would just do that, their lives go so much better. I've had a lot of clean time. I've had a lot of clean time on my bill. I've had periods where I've gone two years. I've had periods where I've gone a year. But I've had some times where I've been doing good for two, three months and I'm doing bad. But this time, I just something snapped in me since I found God that I don't have a desire to do that no more. I don't want to. I don't hang out with no one like that. I just try to keep my distance from people. And it's been doing good. I've got a girlfriend that actually cares about me, that actually wants me to succeed. But there's some days that I do want to get high. And there's some days I don't. But it's the part about it that it killed my mom and my brother. And there's some days that I still want to do it. And it drives me nuts. And I don't know why. But then I turned to my Bible and I read that. Then I call myself there and everything starts going good again. And I just don't know. If I think I did find God, I think I would have died. I've overdosed seven times. I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't be here at all. And some days I wish I could take my brother's place so he could be here. I wouldn't do anything for him. That was my best friend. If I think about every day, if I could change places with him. But I can't. And I know I'm going to keep going and keep succeeding. I had to show him that I can do it. And it took me forever to finally see that. Like, he would not want me here. He would not want me here yet. Hi. No more. He would want me to better myself. And I promised myself if I do have a son, I'm going to name him after my brother. That's what I'm going to do. I want to stay away from drugs. I want to build a family with my girlfriend. I want to keep building a relationship with Jesus. I just want to live a quiet life away from drugs. I just want to be happy. I'm on a really good path. I've had parents that didn't give up on me. They should have gave up on me so many times. I've done that people so dirty. And they still accept me every time. And that's what I try to tell people about Jesus. He will accept you every time if you just give it all to Him. And that's what I did. It has been working out excellent so far. I'm sorry for crying, but I just, man, my brother was my world. And it just all gone because of the chemical, because something that just changes your mindset for a couple seconds, for 30 seconds of high, you're dead afterwards. I don't wish just people would stop and realize that if they don't have family, there's someone out there that does care about them. And there's someone that does give a crap and gives a shit. I try to tell people the whole time, if you're having problems, I'm not a people person. I try to stay away from people. I'm not finnual. But if you've got a drug problem and you need someone to talk to, you can reach out to me. I would talk to you, because I don't want someone to die alone. My brother died alone, and my mom died alone. I don't wish that on anyone. I just wish the world would find love instead of hating each other. And I think no one would even want to do drugs. I think that there is more love in the world when people cared about the person next to them. Instead of worrying about just their feelings and who hurt their feelings that day, the world would be a lot better place. Because there's some people that die alone. And some people are worried about what they get called in their pronouns over people dying. I see all this going on in the world, I see all this political stuff. And I'm thinking about what about all the people that die about drugs? And our country just allows it to keep me flooded in here. And no one does shit about it. No one. They just allow it to keep you at it. It's our responsibility. God gave us free will to not do these things. But I don't think people should still be allowed to make profit and money off of it and then be flooded over here. I don't believe in telling. I don't believe in people getting in trouble. But I don't believe you should keep selling fentanyl. I don't like it. I hate it. And as much as I hate it, it somehow always will come back and bite me in the head and back in my head somehow. I got parents that care about me. I got people that care about me. I tried to tell people all the time, there is one person that does care. You might sit there and think that no one cares about you in that moment that you have no one. But there is someone out there that gives us shit about you. You've got to change your surroundings. The people you hang out with, if you want to beat this addiction, you cannot be going to the same places you get high. You can't be hanging out with the same people you get high with. You can't be new none of that. You have to distance yourself from all these people. And once I got that in my head, it's been like walking apart. It's been so easy to stay clean. Once I actually got away from people and stopped letting them influence me and realized, man, I got a brain. I should use it sometimes. Not other people who use it for me. That makes sense.

WkNbdTWlJVU,"I'm a recovering addict. I was an IV drug user for 15 years and alcoholic for about eight. My mom, who was a foster mother to my kids because I couldn't raise them, I got her addicted to pain pills, in which last year she overdosed and died from. It's my first time to talk about my mom and my involvement in it. Like I said, she had full custody of three of my kids. She had a full-time job and she had hurt herself lifting up one of my kids. I was in active addiction. I was on meth and pain pills and anything you could possibly think of. She called me, she was hurting, and I took her pain pill, told her to take this, it would help her. Then I just fed her addiction after that for many years until I got sober. Then her doctor started feeding her addiction. What led you to get sober? I was tired. I was miserable. I was not only an IV drug user, but I was a raging alcoholic. I was just tired. I didn't want to live no more. I knew that something had to change or I just wanted to go. That was three years ago. Where was your mother at that time? Three years ago. She had got custody of more kids, which are my little brothers, little brothers, children who's in active addiction. She got custody of them three. We all made excuses for her because she was older. She had all these kids to take care of. Her doctor had started prescribing her pain medicine so many a lot, way more than one person could ever need. She was a real deep into her addiction. On top of that, she started also drinking. There's a fine line whenever you're old, you have all these kids you have to chase around, and you sincerely have pain. She's had a couple back surgeries, a knee surgery. She had pain. There's a fine line, not that she didn't need it, but she definitely abused them. Probably six months before she passed away, she got a new doctor and he took her off her methadone because her last doctor was giving her percocets and methadone bolt, 180 of both of them, and she would run out of them every month. Then her new doctor tried to take her methadone away from her and she started getting them on the streets. May 26 of last year, I was sober, had been sober. I lived out of town, worked full time. My stepdad had called me and said, you need to come take the kids for a little while. My brother's kids that were still little, mine are older, because I'm sending your mom to go get sober. I came home today. She can't stay away. She's nodding out. She's slobbering all of herself and her breathing shallow. He sent her down to my sister's, why I had the kids. For two days that she was down there, she was nodding out. We found out that she had gotten some methadone wafers from somebody on the street. That's what ended up. I guess she had some with her whenever she ended up going down there. She took another one on top of whatever she had already taken. My sister woke up and found her unresponsive last May. My stepdad called me and told me that my mom was gone. I actually thought he was lying to me. I told him to quit lying. I kind of cussed at him a little bit. I'm like, you're so down because we haven't had the best relationship. I just didn't. I had just seen her the day before. She had been messed up, but nothing like out of the normal because she was always kind of messed up. They did do a lot of tests and a lot of all. They did the toxicology and all that stuff. It was an overdose from methadone. But nobody investigated where she got them from or anything like that. She was going to find them no matter what. For me, there's a lot of takeaway. Hold your family close. Make memories why you can. Don't feed in to their addiction. Don't enable them. If you see them struggling, get them help before it's too late. Make sure they know Jesus. What got you sober? I was tired. I was miserable. I didn't want to live anymore. It was fun for a long time. My mom had my kids. I could just party up. It just wasn't fun anymore. Everything was so dangerous. Everything being laced with something. To be honest with you, it wasn't even that. I wasn't scared of that at all. I was just tired and broken. I did not want to live my life anymore. I wanted to die. So just the true hard facts is addiction runs so deep that you don't. Not only do you not really care, I think that there's been times where I thought maybe that maybe overdosing or being poisoned was the only way out. As messed up as that sounds. Sometimes when you're an addict, you feel like there's just no hope. There's just no way to stop. Once you've been going through this vicious cycle of treatments, prisons, jails like I had, what is there to possibly, if none of that did it for you, losing your kids? None of that did it for you. Why keep going? So maybe why be scared of losing your life? Do you even really have one? So for me, it was easy. After all this fighting and all this battling with my addiction, I was so tired and so broken. I prayed a prayer man and it worked for me. And I found hope and I found joy. And I found the highest, most holy high I have ever felt ever in my life. And I just clung onto it for dear life and I haven't let go. This is better than any high that I've ever felt ever in my life. So take that feeling and chase that because that is the best feeling I've ever chased. I used to chase drugs that don't have nothing on the high that I'm chasing now. Yeah.",loaded_from_file,5374,METHADONE -Melissa Lansdown's Story,638.0,9,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00
WOi4wV-wfFY,"I'm here to basically just share about my recovery, where I've come from and what I'm doing now. When I was 16, my brother passed away from leukemia, and then about six months later, my mother passed away of ovarian cancer. Prior to that, I was a troubled teen. I was hanging out with the wrong people, wanted to fit in with the gangs. Never got into a gang, but I always wanted to fit in with the gangs. But when my mom and brother died is when I actually noticed myself starting to do hard drugs and doing hard drugs. When my mother passed away, I was in a group home in San Diego, and I didn't go back. They let me out to see my mom get her for her death. I didn't go back to the group home, and my sisters really couldn't take care of me because I was out of control. I had to leave, and I went to Utah with my cousin. Nobody really knew that I was doing drugs. I would say I think, so I thought, I know my sisters loved me, and I knew my sisters were there for me. In my mind, and my thoughts was that I didn't have no one. My mom passed away, and I always felt like she left us, that she gave up on us because my brother passed away, and she couldn't take that. She said, no mothers are supposed to bear their kid. It felt like to me that she just gave up and wouldn't fight no more for her recovery of cancer. When I got to Utah, I didn't talk to my sisters for a while. I was just by myself. I met a lady there, and I had my first son. That turned into me being abusive, and me mentally and physically being abusive to her. She ended up leaving because of the abuse, and I lost contact with her and my son. That's when it didn't get worse. It kind of stayed the same to where I was still getting high every day, and not having a job, not having any kind of income, bouncing back and forth from house to house, losing contact with my cousin that I moved there with because of the drugs. I was in another state basically by myself. She was still there for me, but she really didn't want anything to do with the drugs or people doing drugs because she was an ex addict herself. Like I said, I got out of control. I would be drinking and doing hard drugs for a while, and it led to a night to where I got into a vehicle, and I was driving, and I was drunk, and I hit three cars on the way out of the parking lot. After I hit the three cars, I deliberately ran into my cousin's car over and over. My son was in the backseat. My first born was in the backseat with the mother. That same night, I left from Utah to Tennessee. When I got to Tennessee, the drugs stopped because I didn't know anybody out there. Really couldn't get a hold of anything because I didn't know anybody. No connections, none of that. Still smoked marijuana and drink, but the hard drugs was gone. I lived in Tennessee for about maybe three years, four years, and I ended up leaving Tennessee to move back to California. I noticed almost instantly when I got back to California, the drugs started again. Once again, I got abusive, got mentally and physically. An incident happened one night, and my ex ended up calling the cops on me. I went to jail for about a month for assault. It was corporal spousal abuse, and she left and went back to Utah. I've been trying to get sober since 2016. I've been wanting to get sober. I've been telling even when I was using it, I was like, man, I don't want this. No more. I want to get sober. Nothing never seemed to work. I was always getting clean for a couple of months. I even got clean for a year. Life on life terms happened. Something happened to where I got kicked out of my old Oxford house. My wife that I married when I got here, she wanted a divorce. She didn't want to be with me no more. I lost my four kids. Again, I have four kids here. I got three girls and one boy. Ages seven, six, and three. The three-year-olds are twins. Even when they got taken out of my home, I was still wanting to use. Every time I went to go see them to get a visit, after I left that visit, I would go instantly and get some drugs and do drugs to forget. I love my kids more than anything in this world and would do anything for them. When that drug and that, your addiction has got a hold of you. Even if you say you want to get clean, it's not easy to let go. Like I said before, you have to want it for yourself. You have to want to get rid of everything and everybody that has been hindering you and holding you back because if you don't, you're still trying to set up that reservation by having them still in your life. Well, when I get up for probation, I can smoke weed. If I get up for probation, I can go back and drink. If I get up for probation, I can do all this. When I do this, I can do this. It's not a good thing to have, especially when you're trying to get sober. That I've learned this time around. You got to get rid of all your reservations. You have to want it for yourself and willing to be putting that work to get sober and actually listening to people and taking constructive criticism. The gentleman that when I went through treatment this last time, he was my pivotal moment this time around in treatment. He told me his story. He told me where he's been at, what he used to do, what he used to be like, and where is that now and what he's doing now. He's a single father of his kids. He got his kids back. He put in the work. I asked him, I said, well, what is it that I got to do to be like you, to follow your footsteps and do what you do? And part of my language, he said, shut the fuck up and listen. And that's one thing that stuck with me this last six, five months is when everybody charged talks with me in German, just shut the fuck up and listen. And I've been taking everybody's advice and everybody's criticism and constructive criticism at that. And I wasn't wanting to do that before. He would give me constructive criticism. I thought you were talking crap and you wanted to fight me or you had a problem with me or what I was doing. I wasn't ready to hear all that. This time, what's different this time is that I've added Jesus Christ and my God. I go to church. I haven't been to church. I mean, I haven't missed a day of church since I've been out February 22nd. I got an awesome support team. I got baptized this last Sunday and there was over 24 people that showed up to my baptism. And I took the picture. I wanted a picture before everybody left and I didn't think nothing of it until I was actually sitting at home thinking about it, looking through my pictures. I was like, man. All these people are sober and they're here to support me. And I help them. I help the street team ministry. I help Kelly's dad is mad. I help out my church whenever there's something that I can do to help out the community or give back to the community by feeding the homeless or passing out an arc and or whatever the nalox. Yeah. Yeah. Or just anything that I can do to be of service and to the community, because I was there six months or five months ago. And the other day I went to AA, an AA group and there was a gentleman outside that one of my buddy Larry, he asked if we could take him. So he kind of volunteered me to take this guy to the hospital to get medically cleared to go to Vallejo. And instantly I was like, dude, I don't want to do this. Like, why would you volunteer me to do something like this? I'm here for a meeting. So but I agreed to it. And as I got closer to the hospital, like I got this feeling of New York piece of shit. Like here's this guy is asking you for help to get cleared to go to Vallejo to get to get started on his recovery. And you were bitching about it saying you didn't want to take him. Like you were there five, six months ago when nobody was there to help you get clean or gets over. So I definitely knows what it feels like to have nobody or nothing in your life and nobody wants to help you or, you know, or, you know, feeling, feeling love, you know, nobody's there or, you know, that you're bugging people when you ask people for help. And, and, and I apologize to him for it. And we prayed with them that day when I, when he got out of the car to go into the hospital and he just called me on the way over here, thanking me. And he's still in Vallejo. He's thanking me, calling me, thanking me about for giving him a ride because it started him on his path to recovery. And that did something to me and to my recovery because my first incident was like, I didn't want to do it. But it says it in our readings that somebody asked you for help, go help them. And I just got, you know, like I was supposed to be a man of God and, you know, praying to my God and what my God do this? Would he say no? Would he be bitching about it? No, he would help them. And that's this one thing that I've learned the last couple of days, even today when I was on the way here, you know, that I definitely need to take a step back and start thinking about other people. And when they asked me for help, my first reaction shouldn't be no, it should be from the heart deep down. Yes, I will help you. Just make sure that you want it and that you're going to, you're going to get out whatever you put into it. You're going to have, you're going to have to work because if you're not willing to put in any work or if you're not ready to separate yourself from other people and, you know, don't get me wrong, I don't like being alone at all. I've come to find out that they're your friends. They're going to respect your sobriety and joined a, it's called a parent advisory committee through kind of children's service league that has just started in Topeka. We don't even know what we're doing yet, but we meet once a month. I finished two fathers classes, finished my outpatient, got a car, been having my job for three months, four months now. You know, like it just, it's amazing. I've accomplished so much in the last five, six months that I've ever had in my whole recovery and people can see that. You know, and it's, it took me a while to see my own growth, but other people are definitely noticing it and seeing it. And hopefully in October, I will get my four kids back. So if you're starting this on your first time or even your second, your third, your fourth, don't, it doesn't matter how many times you try to get sober. It will definitely stick if you do this for yourself and you have to want it like you willing to put in the work. If you put enough effort into it as you would getting a bag or getting higher or getting drugs, you will definitely succeed. But God first, pray. I know a lot of people say put your recovery first, but I found out personally that that ain't the way it is. You put God first, your recovery, then you can decide what comes after that. But if you don't have God, if I didn't, when I didn't have God, I didn't have my recovery. You know, I didn't. And I'm not, I wasn't one five, six months ago to say God, Jesus Christ, or pray or none of that, but it's actually working for me this time. Like I've been so numerous of times when I pray, I've been praying about certain things and my God speaks to me in certain ways and I've been, my prayers have been basically being answered by Bible verses in my Bible and me opening up my Bible. And first thing I see is what I'm asking God or what there is on that Bible or in that verse that has to deal with what I'm asking them. You know, and it's amazing. I mean, yes it is.",loaded_from_file,11439,Recovery: Jeremy's Story,984.0,23,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00
WS9mLVt81fc,I'm recovering fit and all addict. I got out of rehab in June and I was scrolling through Facebook and my parenting class advocate had shared something in regards to a Facebook page. I started looking into this page. I figured out that it was a fit and all prevention and awareness page and her and I had started talking and she had invited me to the fit and all prevention and awareness rally tomorrow at the Capitol building and I had asked her if there was anything that I could do to get involved and she had sent me a link to subscribe or sign up to tell my story today. It all had started when I was really young actually. A lot of my family are alcoholics or drug addicts and I've lost a lot of family members due to drug addiction whether that be in prison or in death and I had grown up around addicts my whole life and had realized that drug addiction probably isn't the smartest route to take but going into my teenage years I had started experimenting a little bit with recreational drugs and didn't realize that it was going to be a big problem in my life. Around 13 or 14 I started taking prescription pills and drinking very heavily and throughout those few years I had found a pretty fond liking of prescription pills and alcohol and I had went into high school and continued partying pretty heavily and from there I was kind of like known notoriously for having house parties at my house and having drugs and alcohol and I was very popular in school very talented in school but school just wasn't my interest once I had found drugs and alcohol women and drugs had became more of a thing for me than school was and I didn't realize how quickly it was escalating into something serious. I was 16 when I dropped out of high school and I had started selling drugs to make money because my part time job at fast food restaurants was not paying the way I wanted it to and from there escalated very seriously into me becoming a drug addict full time. I started using very heavily and it's not necessarily something I'm proud of but it is something that is a part of my life and looking back at it I wish I would have taken all the warnings from all my sober family members or family members that had a little better handle on their life than others because they had all told me that it was not going to be a very fun adventure to take but I did anyways and I ended up catching my first possession charge when I was 17 three days before my 18th birthday and I got put on felony corrections and I continued using and I ended up going to jail about two months after I turned 18 for about 65 or 70 days and my probation officer had recommended that I go to inpatient drug rehab and since I was still on juvenile corrections I ended up going to an adolescent treatment center so I did 30 days inpatient at ATC and Olathe adolescent treatment center and it didn't really teach me a whole lot at the time the only thing that I gathered from it was if you use drugs don't get caught using drugs so probably not the best thing to gather from an inpatient drug facility I continued using drugs I got out of rehab in February of 2020 and when I got out of rehab I had my first born child he was still born at six and a half months and it sent me into a very bad downward spiral I started using drugs really heavily again and continued to use drugs very heavily and then covid hit and the only thing that really got me off corrections was the pandemic I didn't have to see my probation officer and I was still very heavily using drugs and I didn't have to take a single I took a ua when I got out of rehab and I passed because it was the first day I was out and then I took a ua at the end of my corrections and I failed and they successfully completed my corrections and I continued to use and sell drugs and things were not bad in my life but they for sure were not good in my life I couldn't hold a job I continued to bounce employment and in between employment I would pick up selling drugs or sell more drugs than I already was and use a lot of drugs in between and uh it really started to get bad when the pandemic started to slow down uh we got off quarantine and I started to go out a lot more and use drugs with more individuals and then I started using heroin and um it wasn't very heavily never intervenously but it was a problem that was becoming in my life um on top of prescription pills and meth and as much weed as I could smoke it was something that like I didn't know the clientele or the individuals to necessarily get to involved with heroin until the pandemic had basically lifted and uh I started going out a lot more and going to the city a lot more to get drugs and I was at a hotel and I was withdrawing from prescription painkillers pretty bad and uh I had told my drug dealer that and he was like well I got this heroin I don't got no prescription pills but I got this heroin and I was like I don't shoot drugs man he was like you ain't gotta shoot it just here take this and I did some and uh it was probably the best feeling I've had in my life up to that point drug-wise and uh it started to spiral pretty bad from there uh it's not like I was doing a lot of heroin but anytime that I could get any heroin I was doing it and uh it only made my prescription pill problem worse I was buying a lot of prescription painkillers and doing a lot of prescription painkillers it was definitely a line that I never expected to cross in my life that is that is probably a true statement for most individuals most individuals probably don't ever think that they'll get to that point as well until they do and then once you've crossed it it's almost like you can't you can't uncross that line you know you can't jump back over it's just something that sticks I had started using fentanyl just on occasion from here to there it's not like I had an addiction to it but whenever I couldn't find any heroin another buddy of mine was getting fentanyl pills and uh I'd go over to his house and we'd smoke fentanyl pills to subside my cravings of prescription painkillers and heroin and uh I didn't let anybody know about that for a while um I had came home to my baby mama's house uh pretty pretty lit and um um I had ended up puking and uh explaining to her that I did not feel very well because I had done fentanyl and heroin and she had asked me what I had thought I was doing with my life at that point and uh I told her just having a good time and she asked me she said does it seem like a good time now that you're on the floor holding your stomach puking up everything that you ingest and uh it didn't really sink in until after that hadn't happened that um it wasn't a good time anymore it was something that I needed in my life and I was 19 about to turn 20 at that point we were actively using together but not she wasn't actively using fentanyl or heroin she was just using meth with me and um ended up uh becoming more of a problem than I had wanted to admit and um when I was 21 I had just turned 21 I had really developed a taste for fentanyl and um um I moved in with this lady to try to subside that because she was against it because she had lost friends to it and I had lost friends to it but not a lot at that time and um I moved in with her and ended up kicking fentanyl for a while um three months I think and then and then once I had kicked fentanyl for those three months uh we were selling quite a bit of drugs and our house ended up getting raided and I went to jail and my kids were taken from me and um when my kids were taken from me uh I got out of jail and I didn't have a whole lot of aspiration that things were gonna get better I had just figured this is probably the best that it's gonna get and I uh continued to use and continued to spiral farther into fentanyl because I was mourning not necessarily uh the death because my kids are still alive but the loss of my children from my custody uh it was very difficult for me to deal with because I had always wanted children and um I was a good father in a sense I wouldn't say I was the best father because being an active addict you can't be the best parent that children need um you could be the best that you could be but children need sober um responsible individuals as parents and uh I was not either of those uh very irresponsible very intoxicated all the time and uh I didn't realize that my drug problem was really a problem until then um but there was not much I could do about it at that point I uh continued using and picked more fentanyl up than I was and it was getting pretty bad uh I had overdosed the first time and got narcanned and uh I could just remember when I woke up I was so angry because I wasn't high anymore and that sounds crazy because they saved my life and I should have been grateful for that but I was really ungrateful for the fact that I was still alive and uh as soon as I woke up I had asked where my drugs were so I could get high again and that's a big reflection in my life because uh the first time it was kind of difficult to even think that that had happened to me I didn't really think anything of it um I just figured it was something that happened to all addicts and um I just moved on from it and didn't think anything of it and then it happened another time and continued happening multiple times more and uh probably about the uh fifth or sixth time I overdosed um I realized that it was a very big problem in my life I didn't know what to do about it because I was so addicted at the time that it just seemed normal to me and I was going through so much in life that I didn't necessarily want to be woken up each time that I was brought back um everybody says that uh mental health is a big part of addiction and that is very true um I was very depressed in life and that probably is what started my drug addiction is depression issues um when it first started um but I didn't realize that until uh all my family was asking me to get sober and I couldn't get sober because I felt as if the drugs made me happier than anything in life could the first time I got high on fentanyl it was better than the feeling of sex hands down I uh I went almost absent for a while just to get high you know what I mean I was getting high so often that I didn't need sex anymore for a while there um it was such a great feeling at first and then I started going through withdrawals and uh that is probably one of the worst things I've experienced in my life uh I've broke bones I've had concussions playing sports I've been in car wrecks you know that is probably overall the worst feeling I've had in my entire life mentally physically emotionally everything above it's just nothing more defeating than withdrawal from fentanyl or opiates in general so I overdosed seven times before I decided that I needed to get sober and uh I ended up going to rehab uh up here in Dupika in May um the first week of rehab was really rough because I was withdrawn from fentanyl so bad before that I got arrested in March and uh I'm a bee box felon and uh I caught new charges felony charges and I was looking at quite a bit of prison time but my attorney had told me that there is um more people get out of trouble with drugs if they change their life here recently than if they continue doing the things they're doing obviously so I had decided that I was going to go to rehab I just needed to get out of jail to get checked in um before I got bonded out of jail uh I had been getting high in jail um surprisingly uh there was a couple people that had been brought in that had smuggled drugs into the jail and we were getting high in jail and um that is probably another time in my life I realized that drugs are a serious problem because I'm sitting in jail for drugs and drug charges and I'm still continuing to use drugs in jail and it's like I probably haven't felt so low in my life um other than that because it's like I wanted to stop using drugs for a while now but the mental obsession and physical craving was so hard to get over that even in jail for drug charges I couldn't beat it and uh I ended up bonding out of jail in April and I talked to my probation officer and she told me that I could get checked into rehab May 10th and uh I continued using all the way up until that day um even hours before I went into rehab I continued to use um so I went into rehab May 10th and that first week of rehab was so bad it was so bad I had absolutely no hope that it was going to get any better but a tech at the rehab had called his wife and uh his wife is a recovery coach for Heartland Radack and um she called a friend of hers who has experienced with fentanyl addicts and uh had gotten some suggestions and they had ended up giving me those suggestions and um I had taken them into consideration and ended up sticking it through and staying in rehab even though I didn't want to I did um and I'm so thankful what I did now uh the first 30 days were really bad uh I had wanted to use constantly had thought about using constantly but I knew that if I use things in my life we're not going to get any better um it was only going to progress to get worse if I continued to use or had used again uh it's going good now um very seldomly do I have thoughts of using uh and I maybe once a week there is a small thought that crosses my mind but I remember how bad it was and uh the things that motivate me to continue to stay sober today and uh it's going pretty well throughout the process of going to rehab I had found um the Oxford Incorporation and had talked to a friend of mine who is sober and lives in Oxford now and uh he had talked to his house president and got me into the Oxford house that he's in and uh I got a job and moved in with them and have been doing the best that I could do to stay sober and healthy to get these things in my life taken care of uh it's not something that is easy by any means but um it needed to happen and I'm so thankful that it happened when it did because I've lost several friends to fentanyl addiction or addiction period whether that be prison or death uh and I'm very thankful that I was not one of those statistics that ended up in prison or in the obituary you you,loaded_from_file,14232,Fentanyl

xjpYOjGyxrw,"I just felt led by the Holy Spirit to share my testimony with God as did and how He's restored me and the Word says He will restore everything that the cankerworm has stolen and that's the truth and I'm living proof of that. So yeah that's it. I hope this testimony just helps somebody else have hope and be a beacon of light in a dark world. It went way back to my childhood trauma. I came from a broken home and although both of my parents always did the best that they knew how to do and I have a relationship with them and love both of them very much, it was some things that happened when I was a kid and it led me to rejection and trauma and just all kinds of stuff and I think stuff like this happens to everybody but it's just how we deal with it and I didn't have anybody to lean on so I just went straight to the world and the things of the world and I was trying to fill a void and that started from a very, very young age. I started smoking weed, then I was drinking women and all that stuff. Then I slowly, slowly progressed and started selling weed. I was 18 years old, I was already selling weed and one thing led to another and the weed wasn't good enough anymore and I started with cocaine and that was a 10 year process probably of the cocaine. I've always done drugs and sold drugs because the life from the enemy was it'll be free if you just sell it and it was so far from free. You're actually forfeiting the things that you should have for this addiction that you feed. The Bible says sin is fun for a season and it's fun for a season but boy, when it's not fun no more, it's not fun no more. The joy is gone out of it and you're just in misery. It's terrible but it was a progression, a progression and it slowly just took a hold of me. For years I was fully functional, a functioning addict. I had a job and a house and cars and everything the world said you should have and I was just completely empty inside, man, just empty. My whole life has just been covered in addiction and a lot of times trading one addiction for another knowing that there was a problem with this, laying that down and then immediately picking something else up to just cover up all the hurt that I had inside. We just led from one drug to the other in a deeper and darker slippery slope every time. Every drug I stopped I would get on a harder drug and then a harder drug and a harder drug and it was just terrible like that. For years I was on cocaine, I sold cocaine and I sold a lot of cocaine. I would say in the top 10 of the largest drug dealers around me I was selling a lot of cocaine. I just kept progressing and progressing and progressing and the cocaine wasn't doing it anymore and I tried meth one night and it was the drug that I grew to love for sure. You pay a price to be on that drug. That drug will steal everything that you've ever known, everything that you've loved, the person you are, the person you are supposed to become. It just robs and steals and it takes you in a deeper and darker pit every time. The further you get involved with it, the deeper and darker it gets. The lie from the devil that I received was you'll get rich selling drugs. Of course I was selling meth and I was tied to one of the largest motorcycle gangs in the world. I was reckless. I was heartless. I was violent. I was all of these things that I did not know how I became that. It was from the drugs is what did it. It was a season after the cocaine where I had gotten a motorcycle wreck and I broke my leg. They put me on pain medication. I spent the next 10 years of my life on pain pills. This was before the fentanyl came out. I had a $300 a day pill habit. I couldn't work or sell enough drugs to feed my habit eventually. I ended up going to the Suboxone doctor and got on some Suboxone and prayed to the Lord and he slowly set me free from that. This was a slow process. It probably took me a year to get off the pain pills. He set me free from that. He also set me free from Xanax addiction. I was on Xanax. I was on cocaine, methamphetamine. He set me free from numerous things. But until this last time with the meth, I never had a relationship with Jesus. I knew who he was, but I never knew him. I knew of him. But even when we're in our addiction, he just wants us to try out him. He wants to help everybody that wants to be helped. So when I cried out to Jesus this time, on my knees and tears, I'll never forget it. His presence came in the room where I was at. And it was stuff coming off of me. I can't even describe to you what happened. And this stuff was just coming off. And he was breaking all the addiction and the years of trauma and rebellion and all of it just broke like a wellspring. And he took the addiction from me that day. I never went to rehab. I never had to do any of that. The Lord did something supernaturally for me. So he'll definitely do it if you let him. I know that I'll never go back to that life ever again. There's no all, there's no desire, no want to. And honestly, I know if I go back to that life, I won't make it out of it this time. I know God showed me in a dream that if I ever went back, I wouldn't live through it. So I didn't have the desire even when he showed me that. But he showed me what he saved me from. He saved me from myself. He saved me from death. In the dream, I was homeless. I was living on the back of a loading dock. He showed me a lot of things that he saved me from. So when you know stuff like that, it makes it a little easier not to go back. You know, I'm doing better than I've ever done in my whole life. I'm married. I have a four bedroom home. I have a wife. I have a job making over $100,000 a year. When I say he'll restore everything, I mean he will restore everything. But I couldn't have done this without him. I tried to get sober in my own strength over my whole life. And until I had somebody to help me, which is Jesus, I couldn't do it. You don't have enough strength in you. You may make it for a season. Some people do recover using other things, but I couldn't imagine trying to live this life and not have Jesus to help guide me. So I think God uses it and God uses a number of things to get people sober. Now I believe God's hand is in that stuff. But I'm not a drug addict no more. Jesus delivered me from that. So I'm never going back again. So I'm fully delivered, sanctified, filled with the Holy Ghost, and that's what I'm going to stand on. I think God definitely uses that though. I agree with that 100%. I think a lot of people that go through that find Jesus through that. I know my case was a different case. He just broke this stuff off. I told my wife, she had a little horror sound in me. She continued to use for two years after I did. I was almost mad at God because I said, look, I know you did it for me. Why can't you do it for her? And he did eventually. But I think if he wouldn't have taken it from me the way that he took it, I don't know if I would ever quit because I loved it. I really did. So I think he had a special measure of grace on my life to lead me out of that like he did. I would say that the word says that Jesus came to set the captive free. And if you're in captivity over a drug, his heart is that you are free. I mean, that's what the word of God says. And he'll do it. You know, cry out to him. He wants us to cry out to him like children. And that's just that's what it is. And that's when it worked because he knows your heart. You know, if you for years I would say, oh, Jesus, help me. And I would know that when I got done saying help me, I was going right to my car and I was going to get high. You know, so he you can trick him. You know what I mean? But when you're really done and you ask, he'll help. There's no doubt about it. Could I pray? I want I'd like to pray for the. So, Heavenly Father, I just thank you, Lord. Father, I thank you for everybody that's going to watch this video. Father, Lord, I thank you for the lives that this will touch. Father, Lord, I ask that for an angelic presence to even be on this video. Father, the fear of the Lord would fall, Father, on these people. Father God, the fear of the Lord would be the first stage of wisdom. Father, Father God, let let them their hearts be soft and Father God, let them repent, Lord. Father, let them turn to you, Father.

YxTxTKfC6-o,"The part of the brain that gets hijacked by anything that can spike dopamine levels too high is the limbic system, a very primitive all or nothing fight or flight part of the brain. And when it gets hijacked, it will defend and seek that which it thinks it needs to survive vehemently. You haven't eaten food for 12 hours. You have tunnel vision, your dopamine plummets, your moody, you will push over small children to get to food. There's a saying, the world is three meals away from utter chaos. It's the same thing that happens when we become addicted to anything, whether that be a substance or behavior, we will say and do anything to defend our need for it. Not to mention, once that part of the brain becomes hijacked, it sends a signal to our prefrontal cortex, which is the part of the brain that gets attached to things that are good for our survival, like people, places and things that care for us and nourish us. But when the limbic system gets hijacked by something that increases dopamine levels too high, it sends a signal to the prefrontal cortex that says, oh, this is really good for your survival. So you should attach to it. So when I hear people vehemently defending their need for cannabis or the reasons that they use it, whether it be medicinal or for pain or any other, I always think about how hijacked their limbic system is and how that reward pathway has sent a signal to their prefrontal cortex that will come up with all kinds of rational and irrational reasons to defend their need for it. There is a state of mind called hypofrontality. Hypofrontality is caused when the frontal lobe down regulates, meaning it moves the electrical activity and blood flow into the limbic system. When somebody is high or intoxicated or scared, the brain mobilizes to either get what it thinks it needs to survive or to down regulate and react out of fear. So when people are using intoxicants or engaging in a behavior that spikes dopamine levels too high, limbic system lights up, the frontal lobe down regulates, almost turning off. The frontal lobe is the part of the brain that has emotion regulation, impulse control, the ability to feel empathy and use abstract rational reasoning. So when somebody is using a substance, especially every day or every other day, their frontal lobe is always down regulated in some shape or form, which means they don't have the kind of normal access to their executive functioning skills that they should have. That means they're going to respond in very immature, selfish, self-centered, self-focusing ways, which is one of the reasons why family members feel so disconnected and don't understand what's going on. It's not their family member. It's literally just an addictive limbic system that is rationalizing and moving toward finding that thing that it thinks it needs to survive, whether that be a drug or a behavior. I was a very rule-following, anxious, wanting to make all a kind of kid until family moved and my parents got divorced and I really wanted to fit in. And so this really cute boy tells me to go to a party and somebody handed me a beer. What I didn't know when I drank that beer is that I have a genetic predisposition that predisposes me to becoming addicted to anything that spikes my dopamine levels. And unfortunately, the beer did. So I kept moving when I was a kid because of all our family dysfunction and I took summer school classes to get to know other kids. Who takes summer school classes, usually the kids who are making poor decisions. So I met a lot of great kids who were making some pretty poor decisions and hung out with them and used a lot of the substances that they did. I really wanted to fit in and then I wanted to take away my negative feelings. And unfortunately, drugs and alcohol are great for doing that until you get addicted and they're the cause of the negative feelings. So I had an overdose when I was 18. And I picked up the phone, the thousand pound phone, and I called my mom who helped me get into rehab. When I graduated from rehab, I went to a halfway house for about six months and I got stable. And that's when I went back to college and I started studying everything I could get my hands on about the brain and addiction. And it was a really cool period of time to study because all of these really cool functional MRI studies were being published. And now I do that as a hobby. I constantly look at fMRI studies. And what I'm seeing is that there are a variety of different high risk behavior that cause hypofrontality. And when your frontal lobe is shut off more than it's on, it creates what doctors call a state of acquired narcissism. The keyword is acquired. When you don't have the part of the brain on that can have empathy, problem solve, make good decisions, use abstract reasoning, then you're really self focused, have difficulty regulating emotion. And so you end up looking like a very self absorbed, self centered human that has difficulty attuning to others. That's when people might call you a dumb stoner or a selfish self centered jerk. But the truth is, without the drugs and alcohol and your frontal lobe turning on, which is the part of the brain that actually attunes to others can calm yourself down, can delay gratification. When that part of the brain is on, you're not narcissistic. You're other focused. You have the ability to stay in your adult energy and have good relationships. Those are unfortunately delayed or disabled when we're using that part of the brain is just not as accessible to us. When you look at the brain in the central nervous system, specifically we focus in on dopamine, because every chemical of abuse out there has in common an increase in dopamine. That's what changes the brain chemistry and hijacks a brain, specifically the limbic system that gets addicted. But every drug also does something else to the brain or body. For instance, alcohol increases GABA, which is our brain's neurotransmitter that calms us down. That's why alcohol can calm us down. Also makes us feel really good GABA plus dopamine. Serotonin is another neurotransmitter that our body helps us to regulate our feelings and make us feel more calm. Now cocaine increases serotonin and dopamine, central nervous system stimulant. So we feel really, really good because of the combination of those two. If you look at any chemical out there, marijuana is another example. It increases dopamine, but it also binds to endocannabinoid receptor sites. We have those all over our brain and body, especially in our gut. And they also increase things like GABA. So they are a replacement central nervous system, depressant. So of course, you can probably stop alcohol if you try using kush or any other synthetic substance that binds to the same receptor sites. But you're not actually solving the problem. You're just switching from one addiction to the other. And that's what things like harm reduction are. When somebody's addicted to fentanyl or heroin, of course, reducing harm to methadone is very helpful because then you don't have the dangerous and debilitating withdrawal symptoms. But now you're hooked on methadone or suboxone for potentially decades, unless you go through the same withdrawal process to get off of them, which many don't because it's so painful. It's been an interesting journey. The first half of my 26-year career thus far was a lot of alcohol and drug issues. The average age was about 15, 16 years old of my clients. Today, what I'm seeing, average age is about 12, 13, 14. And it's a combination of addictive technology, addictive video games. Some of it is early nicotine or alcohol use or marijuana use, but it's more of a combination today. And what I'm also seeing is that the incidence and frequency and intensity of cannabis addiction are skyrocketing. Back in the year I was born, 1970, the average amount of THC in marijuana is about 2%. Today, we're seeing anywhere between 56% and 99%. So the rate at which people are becoming addicted is skyrocketing in proportion to how much THC is synthesized or grown into the plant. So where it used to take maybe two to three years to start becoming or showing signs of cannabis addiction, now it's happening within three to four months. And a percentage of people who used marijuana back in 1970 would have a psychotic episode based upon that. But the percentage was about 2%. 2% of all people who tried weed would have a psychotic episode. Now today, we're seeing that go up to in the 20 to 25th percentile because there's so much more THC. It's just much more potent. So we're seeing more and more people having psychosis. But it's not just what I saw in the 70s or not 70s, but 80s when I was a teenager. You know, it used to be you might have a psychotic episode, go into the hospital for an overnight stay, come out and you're fine. Your brain was able to heal and adjust. And today we're not seeing that. I'm seeing people go into mental hospitals forever changed. I'm seeing parents who are having to figure out how to institutionalize their college age adult children because they can't function in society anymore. I'm seeing kids who are so sick from hyperemesis that they can't eat and keep weight on. I'm seeing people who have chronic pain or chronic anxiety use marijuana to treat those illnesses, but end up with four to five times the amount of chronic pain and not only increased anxiety, but now also psychosis and paranoia that comes with that. Medicine in the term of cannabis is not a real term. It's a marketing term. And the idea is addiction for profit. Our industries don't care what's happening to the brains of their clients. They just want to line their pockets with as much cash as they possibly can, regardless of the public health crisis. And what I'm starting to see is more and more people are starting to know someone that has this issue. The percentage of people who used to become addicted to marijuana back in the 70s was about 9%. Today we're in the 20th to 25th percentile of the rates of addiction. We're also seeing a large percentage of the population who are not using recreationally just for fun. They're getting hooked on it and they're getting hooked quickly. So now they're using on a much more consistent, regular basis, suffering consequences, but are not able to stop. So that's what I'm seeing now in clinical practice. And when I watch the states who are legalizing it, we know that the reason they are is because lobbyists are sharing with politicians very cherry-picked studies on how these things can help or medicate when in actuality the totality of the research on cannabis. And please know I have read every journal article that I can get my hands on from when they started publishing it, but the totality of this research shows that it not only does not work well for treating things like anxiety, depression, or chronic pain, but it exacerbates those issues and causes deleterious effects to the brain, the body, self-worth, self-esteem, academics, career, even IQ, as well as genetic changes that these substances can affect on the body. I have a nonprofit called knowyourneuro.org and I create videos for kindergartners all the way up through 12th grade. It's for schools. I've got about 65 school districts in the United States and two schools in the UK that use it. It's a free prevention program. And so I do a lot of podcast interviews.

ZMETz0qGAYw,"I'm here today because I've overdosed on fentanyl at least 14 times, documented hospitalized 14 times, several other in people's homes, bathrooms, cars. I'm here to share my story of coming from waking up angry that I woke up and doing everything I could the whole day to make sure I didn't wake up the next one and that was from my disease of addiction. So I like to share a message of not if I can do it, you can do it. It's real. You know, it's there are people out there who came from nothing the bottom and clawed their way to the top. And the top looks different for everybody. And I think that's a big part of my goal to share. I'm done. You know, I've been doing it for over 10 years. Both of my daughters, 23 and 26 have been in addiction for 11 years. And my oldest daughter, who's 26. This is her first time in recovery. It's been eight months, but for 11 years she was addicted to meth. And now my younger daughter, Chelsea, she's 23. And she's in recovery. And she was addicted to fentanyl and opiates for about 10 years. And in other rehabs, arrested, you know, all kinds of over. She overdosed 15 times. And the last five, if I wasn't there, she would have died. Thank God for, I know CPR and always have Narcan on hand. I have two memories out of all my overdoses. The first one, I was in a hotel bathroom by myself. And I had shot up in my foot. And so by the time I was done and sat back up, I mean, it was like this beautiful white, just like I was in a cloud. And then next thing I know, I was, you know, flat on my back on the hotel bed. And people giving me Narcan shots left and right, CPR. When they pass out, nod out, and then their breathing is very shallow, can't wake them up. You can shake them. You can scream, but they are not waking up. And then you just start to perform CPR and then give them that shot of Narcan. I'm dialing 911 when I'm starting CPR. And they usually get there within three to four minutes because the fire station isn't too far. And they've gotten to know Chelsea. And they all wish her well. So they usually get there pretty quick to help save her. The second and last memory of an overdose for me, I had had an abortion about two months before I got pregnant with my son. And I was hospitalized for this overdose. And I remember hearing the nurses and hearing everything going on. But all I could see from what I understood where I was at was I was on a beach. And I was walking on a beach with a little girl who I have naturally very curly spiral hair. And I was walking down the beach with a little baby girl who had these beautiful dark brown curls. And it was my daughter. And what I took from it on my spiritual beliefs, that was my daughter kind of, which I don't know if I was pregnant with a female whenever I had the abortion. It's just a vision. It's just something that I saw that I felt that resonated with my soul that it was, it's almost like the child I aborted knew that it was okay for her to go. But it wasn't okay for me to go yet. So she made sure that I didn't. I use anything under the sun, but my favorites were opiates and heroin and Downers. And then when I could get pure 100% pure fentanyl, that was it. It actually started with being in high school, being bullied, started out with mental health issues, depression, isolation. I've been through some pretty traumatic events at very young ages that I never, of course, at five years old, I'm not going to know how to process and cope with and deal with being molested by a... At 12, being sexually assaulted by an older man at 15, one of my best friends overdosing and dying in my arms. At those ages, you don't know how to process that. You don't know what's going on. So when you're... My brain is naturally trying to bring back up those feelings and those... I want to heal. My subconscious needs me to heal. And it's extremely overwhelming and overstimulating. It's to try and... Even if I were to just focus on one single traumatic event, that's... You don't always have an answer, just because you stopped doing drugs. Life doesn't get in... Life doesn't just stop being a bitch. It doesn't... You still have that. And then you have the shame and the regret and the remorse and the what-ifs. And it can get to a point to where I've even thought to myself, well, I don't really even necessarily want to go get high. I just want to die and get it over with. Because if I'm 24 and I've been doing dealing with this since I was 11 years old, I'm fucking tired. She's wrecked four vehicles. Her last accident, they called me at 3.30 in the morning and said that she did not survive. And then I had to get to Memorial Hermann in the Med Center from Conroe. And it wasn't until I got about 10 minutes away when I called the emergency room to see where I needed to go to identify her or find her, the morgue. And the ER nurse said, she's here, she's alive. They did not give up on her in life-flight. And also the first officer on the scene. He was a medic in the service. And he said that he just held her and prayed and prayed. She was scalped from ear to ear. She lost her left ear. Shattered her jaw. Shattered her wrist. And both legs, from the knees to her toes, were shattered. She was in the hospital for six weeks in a wheelchair for three months. And the problem with that was his pain medication. I had to give her something for the pain because it was so excruciating. And then when they cut her off after leaving the hospital, she's already back in her addiction. And she's still in so much pain that she started to get off the streets. And then she made up her mind to stop. I've been a rehab twice. Both graduated successfully, went involuntarily. There's a program based out of Houston, which is the Heroin Emergency Response Opioid Epidemic Services Heroes Group. I have a free counselor, free group with them. Free group every Thursday, one-on-one with my counselor every other week. They got me hooked up with a doctor to treat my opioid use disorder. And it's all free, all voluntary. They hooked me up with a legal team that does everything pro bono for people in recovery. And I have a home NA group that I go to. I'm very close with everyone there. I'm not everyone, but we're family. I've been going there for so long. And it's very rare. It's always the old timers. You don't see many 23-year-olds that are like, oh, I can't wait to go to NA tonight. But that's genuinely how I feel. Especially on Saturdays, we play volleyball after our six o'clock meeting. And it's just in the times where life happens. And as someone who has, myself, has the disease of addiction, I naturally will think and tell myself, I just, I don't know how I could never get through that sober. I could never, you know, how could, how? And I know that I'm surrounding myself with people who will not only show me how to get through it sober, but will hold my hand. I know the people who I'm closest with who are in recovery. I know that, you know, I could call them and tell them, you know, like I. They are the true definition of, you know, the no matter what club is what we call it. You don't use no matter what. No matter what you do, we won't judge you. No matter what, keep coming back. So, you know, shame or embarrassment and stuff like that, that's never been an issue. With my friend, with the people who I've got close to while, you know, being my sober true self. Addiction is a disease. I don't care what anybody says, but it is medically proven that it is a disease and those cravings, just like anything else, smoking or drinking. It's like your body has to have it and it just starts up again from there. Don't think it's not going to happen to your child, to your brother, to your sister, and uncle's parents. You can buy this drug on the internet. You can get it off a Snapchat. They can order it from China and China will ship the pills to a PO box. The law enforcement, they don't have the manpower to keep up with what's coming across the border or open border. And even on the streets, so we as a community need to help them. If you see something, say something. Two kids in the woodlands a year ago, smoked a joint, it had fentanyl in it. They both died. The mom found them in the girls' bedroom. It sent everything. Coke, meth, marijuana. They're putting it in everything. Yeah, I haven't been doing okay. I haven't been necessarily, I haven't been using, I haven't been out on the streets, you know, I haven't been neglecting my son. But sometimes that's all I can think. You know, that'll never stop. But it's, you know, I'm not okay. I know today I'm better than who I was yesterday.

zrq5OSSD2xk,"I was born into a very poor family. My biological father was an alcoholic. He was a very abusive alcoholic. He not only abused my mother, he abused his own seven children. My mother was an angel compared to him. She lived with, was married to him for 25 years. Before she got out of the abusive relationship, I never comprehended that it affected me. That stuff just rolls off my back. It didn't bother me that he beat me, beat my mother, everybody. When I was about 13 years old, I lived in California and I hung out with the hippies. I started smoking weed, man, when I was like 13. I didn't consider it the gateway drug that caused other addictions. I consider it, it put me in the environment with other drugs. Anyways, I started probably experiencing with pills like white crosses and black beauties back in the days, what they were. When I was about 15, I guess I started the pills and stuff. By then, my mother had already met my dad. I call him my dad, he's my adopted dad. He was my A1. Treated us kids real good, real good. We weren't used to that. But anyway, still, I started doing drugs and stuff, no matter how good my childhood had become by then. Lo and behold, I was selling marijuana. That's all I was selling for a long time, to get the good stuff that a lot of kids, don't get me wrong, even though my mother remarried my dad, we weren't rich by no means. So I ended up, a friend of mine came to me and said, I know a way you can make some good money. I said, I'm in, selling meth and fat amines. Of course, you can't do a sell product unless you try it. So I tried it. Become an intravenous drug user. I was on drugs probably 30 years of my life. I got to take a break. I never understood really, I just thought I enjoyed doing drugs. Party with my friends, party with everybody, you know? I didn't realize, I'm not going to give my age away. Tell a few years ago that my early beginnings in life was really working more mental on me than I thought. But back to when I was doing drugs, because of my circumstances, one night I ended up walking on a dirt road. And I dropped my knees, talked to the man, talked to my God. And I promised him, if he'd get me out of the mess I was in, and take that monkey's, what we called it, drug addiction, away from me, I'd never do it again, never. The police were looking for me at the moment, but they ended up taking me to a homeless shelter because I had nowhere to go. I kept my promise. I never went to rehab, no NAA, whatever. I never did drugs again after that. Now, here I was homeless, had nothing, closed on my back. I worked really hard and went by the grace of God. And my best friend, Rick Robertson, he sent me to trucking school, and I wanted to become a truck driver. And I now own my own home, my own land, have a nice car, nice pickup truck, you know. Have food, lots of food, because lots of food. Everybody gets on me about that, but I've been hungry in my life. You know, my closet's full, nobody can share a closet with me, because I have lots of clothes now. I think a lot of that started also from my childhood, you know, and like I said, I never thought it bothered me, you know, I'm a tough old girl. But in the last three years, maybe, I've realized that I believe that's what led to my addictions, and also addiction from my biological father's side of the family, you know. They were all alcoholics. But like I said, it's by the grace of God that they didn't have fentanyl back then, because I would have died 10 times over, you know. And it's by the grace of God that I'm clean today, you know. Didn't need no rehab. I'm not saying rehab and NAA is not a good thing. Some people, they need that 12th step. They need to be accountable. What I'm saying is what worked for me was that night on the dirt road. What kept me is my job as a truck driver. I'm being accountable to God, but also with my career. One time, a dirty UA, I'm out. I feel I stay accountable to keep my career now, you know. Don't get me wrong, have I ever been to some of the meetings with my friends or whatever? Yeah, I have. Did I get anything out of it? Yeah, I did. Keep doing what I'm doing. You know, I did run down in my little town, the NAA program, meaning I furnished the place, I furnished all the literature myself to help others to get out of that addiction. Did it work? Some of them, yes. Some of them, they were there to get that PO stamp, you know. But I did that. I've talked in the church that I had been going to about my addiction out into public, you know, the people there. There was young teens there. You know, I've spoke to about my addiction, you know, and tried to keep them stay away from it, you know, not be like me, you know. I don't want nobody to be like me. You know, I went years being addicted, like I said, about 30 years. I was using some kind of drug, you know. It's not easy to quit. It's not. Like I said, some people do need those meetings. Do you need that 12-step to stay accountable, you know? You need that sponsor to win your week, to call, and they're there for you. You have to have a solid person in your corner. You know, I had God and my best friend Rick Robertson, you know. I stayed accountable to him, you know. Have I ever sometimes had the urge? Sure. I get ahold of Rick Robertson and God, you know. The other thing, be true to yourself. Be true to yourself, you know. When you get that urge, call a friend, you know. Call me, you know. And I do have friends that do that. Lily, I've got to come over for a while, you know, that are still active, or trying to get off, you know. And they, you know, lead by example. Have I went back into those places where I used to sell drugs? Sure I did. They sent and doing. And I'm an example, they're wondering, how can she say no when she used to be a drug addict, just like me? I don't need it. I don't need it. I got a better high. I got a better high. It's a life. It's called life. Because when you're in an addictive situation, you're not enjoying life. You're enjoying the high, but you're not enjoying life. You know. Another subject me and Glenn's talking about earlier was I had to live in a little town. One intersection, one gas station. Do we have a fentanyl problem there? Yes we do. Yes we do. I try to help educate. I sit at that little gas station by myself. Pass out in Narcan. I don't promote drug use, but I pass out test strips. If you're going to use it, test it. Life-saving resource literature, things like that. And we were speaking about that I said, there's no heroin, white china, there's no heroin. It's fentanyl. And in my little town, I have heroin addicts that think they're doing heroin and I try to educate them. No you're not. There's others that know it's fentanyl and they don't care. You know, they haven't lost anybody that they love to fentanyl poisoning. I've lost two grandchildren. And I try to educate them, but a lot of people don't want to be educated because addiction is more powerful than death. They know there's that opportunity to, you will die, not you might die. You will die eventually from fentanyl poisoning is what I try to educate them. And that addiction has more power than the drug itself. Nowadays, fentanyl is in everything, even in marijuana. If you're not getting your marijuana from a dispensary, you're taking a chance with your life. They say seven out of 10 pills are fake and made of fentanyl, you know. I'm only one person in my town. I want to save everybody, but they're not going to listen just to me, you know. Who am I? I'm an ex junkie, you know. I wish our government would put a stop to the fentanyl coming through the borders. I wish our government would stop the Domenis Lupo. It is a bill that the United States signed with China in 1939 that if the package is valued at $800 or less, then they pay no dues as in taxes or import fees. The package, if it's $800 or less, is not vetted. It's not x-rayed. It's not dog sniffed, pass go. And this is on a daily basis. And I ask people when I do my presentation, what does any American need a pill press for? You don't make your own medicine. You don't make your animals medicine. And those packages that's coming in from China, imported from China, also has those pill presses in them. That's how they're making the fake pills over here. Every parent needs to know what their child is doing on these telephones, on these computers, because a lot of kids are getting drugs delivered to them through Snapchat, TikTok. I mean, God forbid if that's the way it was when I was a kid. A lot of my friends that I met through fentanyl awareness, their child was in bed. They wake up the next day, their child's dead, because they got on a social media platform, ordered one percocet, put the money in the mailbox, was told go back to the mailbox to pick up your drug, and then they would be dead the next day. You have to know exactly what your child is doing at all times nowadays. God forbid if my mother had to keep track of me, she'd odd run a ragged. I'm glad I don't have children. I have grandchildren though. And like I said, I lost two. And I have educated my other grandchildren to where I don't think I'll ever have to worry about losing another one. Because they're very highly educated, you know. So anything else? I think that's good.",loaded_from_file,9324,Lillie's Story - A Better High,991.0,7,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00
Zx2WzT5m1uk,"Well, like the first time I smoked weed, it was with my cousin. I was like 14 at the time and my parents were on vacation and he was kind of house sitting with me. He's older and right now he's in his late 30s, but at the time he was in his late 20s or so. And yeah, he just had a joint and he thought that it might be a good idea to show me what it's like. His thinking on it was, well, you're still young and I want to be here with you for your first time so that your first time isn't at a party. That was his rationale behind doing it. And so I was like, okay, I wasn't at all into drugs before that, but I had a puff and I felt not much. I felt really lazy and chill, but then I fell asleep watching a movie and it was great. But that was a 14. So over 10 years ago, or about 10 years ago exactly because I'm about to turn 24. So yeah, that's kind of where it began in terms of the first time using cannabis, but I didn't smoke for another two years after that. If I did, it was one time here, one time there with maybe a friend, but super minimal until I was 16. That's where it picked up the pace. Like sophomore year, like summer started hanging out with a lot of people that were associated. I dropped out of the high school I was going to. I'd gone to like two high schools before, but then the third high school, it was kind of notoriously known as like, me and my buddies have like a term now that we've developed for people who smoke weed endlessly and are kind of rotting away. It's called weedoid. So I think like I was at the weedoid school and there was a lot of people who partook and I wasn't really opposed to it at that time. I didn't know like any of this was going to happen. Right. Like I was totally in the blind. So yeah, started smoking a lot with a bunch of friends from high school. It started off social. That's not how it went though. Like it didn't progress being a social thing. It ended up being an isolated thing that I resorted to because I started losing friends funny enough, you know, dropping out of classes, getting skipping school to go smoke, having like cravings so bad that like, oh, I'd have to miss class. And even if I didn't have a friend to go with, I'd do it by myself and then started the whole train of like, oh, I wake up and do a Waken Bake, you know, by myself in my car, whatever, before class. Like I have a pretty fond memory of when I was a senior Waken Bake. I do that almost every day and I go to the theory of what was it, TOK theory of knowledge and my my professor, my professor there, my teacher was Christopher Courtney Christopher and he was like a old X Marine who used to fly helicopters, like Chinooks and crazy big helicopters in the Marine Corps. He knew I was high like coming into his class all the time, and I would act out a fool. Almost every class I'd start, you know, crazy debates about random stuff, but, you know, he allowed it and he was there for me and he would like let me engage knowing that I was baked out of my mind but, you know, that's probably many other students that were going there because that like I said, notorious school for that. You know, there's, I'd say three major high schools that's like the MCPS in Missoula that I went to. There's Big Sky, which I started at, I left there and then I went to Loyola. That's more of a private school that's not associated with MCPS and then there's Hellgate. Hellgate, that's the third one I went to where I graduated the notorious school for that. And then there's Sentinel, which is like the jock kind of sporty school that, you know, has its own little kind of clicks. I didn't want to go there. Wake and bake. I've never heard that term before. That's that just means just what it says, I guess. Yeah, it's pretty self-explanatory. You wake up and you get really high and then do whatever, probably go do random stuff. I know some, there's people that like go to work after that. There's people that, you know, go lift, go work out, you know, different activities. Some people just stay in bed, wake and bake and then stay in their house and do nothing and then smoke more. I was more of that type where I would kind of, you know, isolate. It's different for every person and for me it was very isolative. That's the biggest thing I can equate it to. I didn't want to hang out with people at a certain point after smoking. It became not social. Yeah, I started fearing people. Like I started fearing interactions. I'd go to parties and I'd think all this crazy shit and I was like, what am I thinking like? At the moment now I think back on it. I'm like, wow, like how could I be thinking this stuff? Like how is my brain processing that as like a reality? The most like that I can equate it to would be like the grandiose thoughts. Like thinking of either myself as something who I'm not somebody or thinking other people are, you know, something else that they're not. And then thinking like just like I have control over certain things which nobody would ever have control over. Or like that I can dictate how the interactions go just in my head thinking it. But yeah, just like it. It's a lot of really hard to explain things. Because like I said, like psychosis for me at least it's really hard to like pull back the memories and recount a lot of it. Just because it was so much like at a short span it like just compressed into this memory chunk that I have a hard time like decompressing and pulling apart and seeing what, you know, I can remember from it. I'd say like I got caught up in the vortex of addiction. And when that began, it was it was just hanging out every day and doing stuff with friends, smoking and not thinking much about it getting with like chicks who smoked a lot. It's like a culture for sure. Like Missoula is known as being a very large dispensary city. I mean, it's just like statistic that I put out it like I said this on Dr. Phil, but it was like it's got the most dispensaries per capita in the entire United States, which is still true to this day. You know, so there's it's everywhere. It's abundantly available. And when it kind of spiraled really is when I got my med card, I got my medical card my license for buying weed. And like that's been like 60 80 bucks per week on that stuff, maybe more, you know, up to 100. It was like a cash venture of mine to like go and spend money to smoke and, you know, that was just like a financial aspect but in part like the mental aspect, you know, it was just a very slow degradation until a certain point. And that was like when I had the first experience with psychosis and that kind of set my my mental on fire, you could say. We didn't know what was going on with him. We didn't know why he was acting so crazy. Why he was so defiant and and mean spirited hard to get along with. We didn't know why we didn't know what was going on. The first time it really happened. I want to say it was around the late 2018. Early 2019 and before COVID. It was it started off as like getting in fights with my parents a lot in my house getting aggressive, having outbursts of anger. Hanging out a lot with friends that I would smoke with like it was still at that point a slightly social thing where I would, you know, try and engage with others, but it would only be like for smoking like I'd only hang out with them if they were going to smoke and we would do that. So, and it just kind of started from there like the Alpers leading to me like wanting to leave get out of the house. Well, it's kind of broke and so I can't really afford housing and I thought the next best thing would be like go staying at the at the Poverello Center, which is a homeless shelter in my city. So I like stayed there for a week just out on the street didn't have really anything to my name except for like a car and some stuff that I had because I had taken my car Honda and. I just parked it over there and started like making friends. I always want to say like quotations with those type of friends, because they weren't friends. They were definitely just people taking advantage of me. Co dependent. Yeah, for sure. They they they saw that I had stuff and saw that, you know, I had money or whatever and I didn't have a lot, but I had enough to like go buy stuff maybe here and there. So yeah, just like and they're homeless people like it was like people in the 40s 50s like just meeting me I'm like an 18 19 year old kid or 18 year old kid and so. It was kind of scary like thinking about like a lot of the stuff that I did it it all has like a you think about like someone doing that at my age and it's like a lot of the people I was interacting with or way older and they had histories and backgrounds and a lot of criminals so like it was some scary shit I got involved with but you know a lot more scary in the in the later phases where I started leaving Zula but the first time I gave away my car. Started walking around town just all over as complete psychosis like it's and it hit finally at this like breaking point. Because I remember like right before this kind of occurred I had like a mental kind of shift that happened with my buddy's house when we were smoking and he gave me his bong and I hit it and like I hit the bong all the time so like I didn't think this was going to be like super different but I took a really big hit and it was like what they call a chop where you mix like cannabis in with like tobacco and we had like American spirit light blue and so he makes the two and then we I smoked it and all of a sudden like I hear this click or like a pop in my head and it was like a like like something like shallow I can equate it to like glass shattering kind of in my head and it was very quick like kind of split second and I kind of freaked out. I was like acting all crazy my my buddy had to bring me back to my parents house and that was right before I started going and doing all this stuff at the homeless shelter and so that's kind of what I like. It kind of all began from that like one little time that I didn't really expect for it to happen. Yeah, so and it led up to me like doing a bunch of crazy stuff getting the cops called on me. My mom especially called the cops like eight times in one day and they didn't really do anything and then she had to go to the district attorney and they had to do an involuntary hold to get me in the psych ward. And so they did that and then the police came and they put put me in the psych ward and then that's kind of the end of the first one but just the beginning of like how it really went. I couldn't believe that it was a thing until it happened to Kobe and the psychiatrist that had diagnosed him with cannabis induced psychosis in the psychiatric hospital. He was in had said it's a thing and he sees it a lot and he explained to me what it was and how he could never smoke weed again. I'll say this like it wasn't logical. There wasn't a logic there. My sentence of logic had completely dissipated to nothing basically. I wasn't thinking in a logical form. I was thinking in a you know, I would like to say creative but it was just stupid and there was a lot of things I was like thinking that were because it's like you create your own little world and everything inside of that world that you're interacting with the people and the things and everything around you is like you create your own storyline for every little thing that is involved and it doesn't work like that world the world that we were then is like you very unpredictable and a lot of different factors come in play and other people have different things involved with their story and it mixes and so what I had to learn through all the psychosis was that my story like of who I am and what I did. It matters but it's not the only one and there's many more and there's so many other people out there that have you know it's similar experiences but also to a different capacity and there's a lot of variations you know on my there's different spins on what psychosis looks like and I think that's important. It was like just me giving away my car is like one thing but there's people that you know gave away a lot more or even lost a lot more spent more you know. We didn't know it was a psychosis at the time that he was at a homeless shelter and then the next day my husband saw him at the homeless shelter standing outside on the street out of his mind out of his mind and I immediately when he told me that I immediately went down to the street in front of the homeless shelter and found him. I started to talk to him. I videoed him and called the police and luckily that time they took him to the hospital and they kept him there. That was a I didn't have to involuntarily commit him at that time but I had to I had to two other times and it's really hard to involuntarily commit them. But that time he did go to the hospital and they kept him and that was that was a really good thing. It's a really good thing because that's what they need. They need hospitals medication when they're like that. I was still super psychotic. They had me on meds that I didn't know what was what it was. I had to learn they were they didn't know either. They had no idea. I mean thankfully we had one doctor who had a somewhat base knowledge of cannabis induced psychosis and that it was a thing. He didn't know that like how to what extent it could go like how severe it can be. My case was pretty severe. He told me and it's interesting because now I work for the hospital that I was admitted to. And so I get to see a lot of the stuff that I was once a part of kind of in the psychotic universe. But yeah like it's it's definitely a thing and for the first time it was I went in there and I was calling myself beside and I had people interacting with me that were also psychotic from other drugs that we were just messing around. You know coming up with our own little weird things. We'd wear like little capes around our heads and we'd think all this crazy stuff together and you didn't really change much but the hard medications they had me on kind of forced me out of it quick. So they pulled me out of it kind of ripped me out of this psychosis and I don't think that's a good thing to do to someone. I think you have to kind of take them away slowly and make them understand because I didn't understand what I was experiencing. I didn't understand how to get out of it and I wanted to go back because I liked it. It was like a thing where I was like oh this is fun you know I'm enjoying myself to my own virtues and my own kind of wants and desires I had going for myself. But that's not how you do it. You know I had lithium. They put me on a lot of lithium. They put me on depico G-a-don like some hardcore antipsychotics. Those rip you out and they turn you into a shell you know and it's pretty obviously known by a lot of people at this point that very very hardcore antipsychotics can leave people feeling soulless like nobody like they have no thought. Instead of the miles and miles a minute I'd be going in my head it was like zero. It was like I was almost backwards like I couldn't think. I couldn't think. It made you where you had no thought for yourself and that feeling sucks and I didn't like it and I was used to the feeling of me thinking a million miles a minute of all this cool crazy stuff that I thought was real and believed. After he told us oh yeah he understood he was just telling us that he didn't really want to stop at that he didn't think it was the weed that did that to him. He smoked weed again after that and that was the second then we went through a second psychosis that was even worse. And you don't know if they're ever going to be normal. You don't know if they're ever going to come out of it. Do they have schizophrenia forever? Do they have bipolar? Do they have other disorders that they never had before? They never had. Kobe didn't have. He didn't have anxiety, depression, all these things, these bad things that they say he didn't have that before smoking weed. And the idea of having a predisposed way about you. That whole thing is kind of, it's still true in some ways but there's a lot of kids that don't have any predisposition that's happening too. Seven year olds it's happening too. Seventy two year olds it's happening too. And it's the high THC and that's all. It's high THC. I only have myself to blame in all of this and I totally take account for that. But that being said, if I hadn't smoked weed none of it would have happened. I can guarantee you that. I promise. Because when I was smoking weed it was that. I didn't smoke anything else. I got it from a dispensary. People are like, they tell me they're like, oh, it wasn't weed. You were smoking something else. Obviously. I'm like, well, okay. So then you're telling me the dispensary is lacing their weed. Like that's crazy. You know, and that's all I smoked. Dispensary weed. Okay. I didn't get this stuff off the street, man. Like once I got to the homeless shelter, maybe that's a different story. But by that point I was already in psychosis. And maybe that's spurred it even crazier. But what really got the fire going was smoking the high content THC weed that I would get. I'd get 40% bud from the dispensaries. They were up in the levels there. Like it was getting high. That's really not known for like flour to have 40%. But where I'm from, Missoula, we kind of get crazy with it. They tend to go high with the numbers get like as high as you can go. So yeah, I mean, that's kind of a trigger for me, I'd say like there's some things that trigger me and people who come at me and they don't know. And I totally get it. I love it when they're skeptical. I love skeptics. I love people who question and with reason and knowledge, but people who just like shoot blanks at you and they're like, they don't know anything. It's really it can get agitating for sure. They blame it on everything else but weed. And that's like kind of going back to like the weed oids that's always the people who smoke. You know, and it's pretty much always that like there's very few people who don't smoke or don't use weed that have come at me and they're like, well, you're wrong. You don't know anything. It's always people who smoke. I'm like, I don't get it. There's no words to describe how horrible it is. There's not anybody that I know of that will understand it unless they've gone through that. It's just that bad when it happens. It's just that bad. You think they're never going to be okay. You know, you don't you can't believe that it's weed that did this for one thing. Then you realize, well, okay, you start to research a little and you start to find out what the real facts are. And you know, I have worked in the court system for a lot of years and my husband is an attorney for a lot of years and we're not, you know, we're not dumb, dumb, about drugs or crime or criminal. You know, we understand drugs, what drugs do, but we didn't have any idea that weed was going to do this. It got bad to where now I don't drink. I don't smoke. I don't do anything because I know that my mental state is very important and that's a hard one. Yeah, because a lot of people like take advantage of that. A lot of people take advantage of their own mental health and like they see it as like the thing you can play with and a lot of people die because of it. And I know a lot of people who died because of it. And so like when people say like it's not a serious thing, well, I like see it as a very serious thing because I played with the fire and I got burned by I'm still here, you know, and so I don't know, man, I end up crying a lot because of this shit. And my friends always make fun of me from the Dr. Phil show because I was crying like a baby. But it's emotional, man, like a lot of this stuff is like very, it's not necessarily fresh, but it packs a lot of weight with it. So yeah, and I'm not a very emotional guy like I don't cry. I cry very rarely, you know, but when I start thinking about the other people and how lucky I am because I really did get lucky, you know. The doctors, the nurses and the ER that Kobe's been to and the psychiatrist that has diagnosed him with cannabis and psychosis, they've all seen it all the time. They see it all the time every day. And we don't, we didn't see that, you know, we didn't know about it, but they did. They see it. Police see it. Teachers see it. You know, people that work with kids see it when it does to them. I have only God to thank for the fact I'm still here. And I think he's a big reason why I am, you know, if I took the other route, I'm sure I'd probably be dead by now. I know a lot of people that go down that route and they don't come back. It is a whole other hell that parents or that third loved ones have to go through. It's a whole other hell on top of, on top of knowing they're crazy and they're walking around like they have schizophrenia. They're darting in and out of traffic. They can't, they can't take care of themselves. It's that, that's one hell. And then the other hell is involuntarily committing them to the hospital. It's really hard to do. You have to call the police over and over and over and try to get them to see what's happening here. Try to help them understand this is he can't take care of himself. He's a danger to himself. I'd say the most serious part for me, seeing my reflection in the mirror when I was in Yolo County in Sacramento, Woodland. And I had horns, full on horns, like protruding from my head. And that scared the shit out of me, man, because it was so real. Like there's nothing realer I've ever seen than my reflection in a little slit in my cell door that represented like the devil in myself. And so my throat seized. I completely shut down like my body. The next thing I remember I woke up in the jail cell and they're like, you can go now. Because at this point I was like, you know, you ask how seriously gets like, I had to fast forward a little bit for that, but that's serious. You know, that was my kind of last episode. That was the third and final over in Woodland. My husband and I finally decided that we were going to get help as a family and have a, it was like a life coach. And we set boundaries about what we're not going to allow and what we are and that here's what's going to have to happen. And this life coach talked to Kobe and I and my husband several times throughout the week. And if there were any issues or problems, he would talk to Kobe for us and reiterate what those boundaries are. And I could drug test him whenever I wanted to for marijuana. His drugs were always marijuana. It was marijuana that did it. It wasn't other drugs. It was marijuana. We get a guidance counselor, life coach kind of. And we had to do like, I had to do zoom meetings like every day basically with him. Started going to groups, you know, like narcotics anonymous. I started going to alcoholics anonymous. You know, I started just doing whatever I could to like grasp at other sources of joy, because everything that I had known up until then, since I was like 16, which now then I was like late 19, almost 20. It had become just a different life. Up in like, just my head like creating this own reality and universe that like I was so used to, it's hard to get out and it's hard to find other sources of joy, you know. So just reaching out and getting help in my support system that I had was really good. And so like, I'm really thankful that my parents and I had friends that saw that I was trying to get better and that I really meant it. You know, I had a couple slip ups along the way. Nobody like does sobriety perfectly. That's for sure. But the fact of the matter is I had scared myself enough to be like, this is not how I should live. And I need to protect my mental state because that's something that is a gift. And it's something you should preserve and build upon, not degrade and destroy, you know, why build a bridge is to burn it. His life coach gave him ideas of what he thinks he should do. And that meant going to, even though he wasn't an alcoholic, he wasn't, didn't have a problem with alcohol. He went to AA meetings. He went to meetings with other people where he could talk. And that helped a lot too. But he got through it. Yeah, he got through it. And he wants to be a psychiatric nurse now. He's going to school and he's doing really well. I got a whole life ahead of me and I'm just very grateful. You know, I'm at a point now where I'm like kind of over the hump that I think a lot of people have later in life too. I've realized that like, I'm very young for like my experience in terms of what I've been through and the shit I've learned. And I've been told that by a lot of people. So I know it's got some truth. But I'm not like as smart as like someone who's 40 and had been through this in their 20s, you know, they know a lot more than me. But I'm okay with that. Everyone knows a little bit different about everything else. They've got knowledge in all different aspects. And I love talking to people who have knowledge about this stuff or experience in some of this stuff, because they tend to understand where I come from. Like when I talk to people my age about it, a lot of the times I have a... they don't buy it. They come in and they want to blame the other stuff like we were talking about. But yeah, I'm like I said, working at the hospital I was admitted to, and it's been really good. I've been able to help somewhat. That's a crazy experience, by the way, working in a mental health, like working in a psych ward that you were once admitted to, like it's wild. It's a weird, it's a trip, but it's cool. I'm helping. I'm a CNA. So like right below a nurse, if you were to look at it like on a tax bracket, I'd be right below the nurse on the tax bracket. Like two below, but yeah. CNA stands for certified nurse's assistant. Yeah, so like in the main hospital I'll like white butt and I'll like help people to the bathroom and maybe clean up some pee if they pee on the floor, call the security if they're getting mean. Yeah, just kind of like stuff you do in a hospital and helping people, which is cool. It's like what I want to do. And the whole thing I've learned here, like doing all my stuff, it's like, well, at least it helped me find my kind of calling, you know, I kind of figured it out now. Because I didn't know I wanted to be a nurse. I thought I was going to be like a lawyer. I had thinking that I was going to be some sort of game designer or having to do with, you know, some sort of software design, computer science. That's what I was in college the first round I went and that did not work out. But now I'm going back for like a nursing degree. So I a little bit of diamond in the rough finding that for me, just a calling that I want to help others and that's a big part of what I'm doing now like with this even just trying to get the word out because people like, like, you know, is like, they won't believe me. And I know a lot of people are going to comment, and they're going to say like, Oh, he doesn't know shit. He's going to blame the weed. He obviously has mental problems. And it's his parents or they'll blame anything but it. That's okay. You can do that. But there's going to be a couple people that maybe see this and they're like, they see some truth in it. So yeah.

_Zn66D2SQOo,"I'm lucky to be alive. I've had several overdoses. I've been in and out of prison, jail, poverty, homelessness, missions, you name it, you know. So I'm here to talk about my recovery is what I'm here for. Yeah, I'm about my addiction to my, well, not just my addiction, but my disease to drugs and fentanyl and pills and everything. I started when I was 13, had a really good childhood, had a mom and a dad who worked their butt off to support me and my sister. I only had one sibling. Both of my parents were addicts growing up. All my aunts and uncles were addicts. I had a lot of cousins that were addicts and they went with the lifestyle. At 13, I got really sick and talked to my dad about getting some help with the pain that I was going through. My dad had ended up giving me some 1000 milligram Norcos. When I was 13, he gave me two of them. Instantly, it was like instant gratification is what it was to me. I had the minute that it happened, minute it hit me. I just something inside of me just craved it. It was my disease starting. I took the pills and continued to ask him for that. As an addict, we tend to have this craving that pushes us towards finding means and ways to get more in life. That's where that started. I started doing that. Around age 15, I continued taking pills the whole time. I continued taking my parents pills where I joined a family of pill poppers. I didn't know what I was getting into at the time. It was more of a mental high than it was a physical high. I didn't really feel that the high after a while. I had gotten to a point where I was getting high off of the middle obsession of finding these pills, of being in a circle where people were searching for that endlessly. At 15 years old, I was full blown addict. I was in Northern California in a town called Woodland. I had a disease in my ankle called plantar spasiatis. I had gotten a doctor in Northern California. I'm not going to say his name, but he prescribed. He was the same doctor who prescribed my dad and my mom a heavy amount of pills. He had prescribed heavy amount of pills to me at the time. All together, I was getting about 180 norcos every two weeks. I had gotten a repetitious cycle of how I was taking them. I took them two at a time and held every hour on the hour. I also started my first job at 15. I started working for a high-end grocery store in Northern California, which I would say today made my disease progressively worse, being able to cope with living on drugs around civilized people who dealt with day-to-day problems. I got good at it. Anybody who came to me at that time, who came to me with a problem for drugs, I had a way to get them on and I had a way to get them off. I was good at what I did. Kept doing that till the pills went on and it ruined my family. It made me act such ways that I'm not proud of today. It held me back from achieving goals, held me back from expressing how my heart really felt. It held me back from understanding depression and things that life was going to throw at me. I remember the first time I got clean was at the end of being 19 years old. My mother, who was also a pill addict, my mother came to me and asked me, she said she wanted to get clean, that she couldn't take it no more. I told her, I said, I agreed with her. Being a pill addict, I said, more for me. She asked me to get clean with her. My grandfather was on hospice at the time and she just couldn't take it with the drugs the way it was going. She needed the cycle to stop. For the first time in my life, I offered to get clean off of the pills. I wasn't ready for it. Didn't want to, just didn't want to lose my mom. Whatever she wanted to do, I was going to go with her on it. We ended up going to a, we couldn't do it cold turkey because the pain and mental obsession of it wasn't going to work. At that time, it was around 2000, I believe 2010 or 2011, we had went to a, they were offering addicts such as myself at the time they were offering us a liquid methadone daily treatment. You would have to wake up early in the morning, like any other pill addict would chasing the bag. You would get to, you would get there at six o'clock in the morning and take your dose. Well, depending on how much you take on a daily basis, you take 60 pills or you take 20, they're going to give you a certain dose. Well, I started mine out on just about 20 milligrams of liquid methadone on a daily basis, and my mom started at 60. I remember, I remember like it was yesterday, I looked at the sign, they said, it said something about if you use narcotics with this time released liquid methadone, it could hurt you. Me and my mom did that for about a month as my grandpa was getting sicker and sicker on hospice. My grandpa ended up passing away, old age and whatnot. We came into a lot of, came into a lot of stuff, came into a $500,000 house, came into a bunch of money, you can only imagine what addicts do with money. I'm like a ticking time bomb with money even today. I'm not good with it. So we ended up, my grandpa ended up dying. My mom had came to me and said that she couldn't live without my grandfather. So, and I didn't know what she meant by that. I went on and off with my mom acting suicidal my whole life and all kinds of hardship with that growing up. I ended up getting a dentist appointment in the middle of that, and they pulled like four of my teeth. So I've come today to realization that I can't hold another addict's step against myself. But me and her giving each other medication throughout my whole life, since I was 13 years old, it happened again. I had told the dentist I didn't want any narcotics at the time because I was at the program that I was at. They gave me, they ended up prescribing me just in case. They ended up prescribing me 16 vikin and hydros and I had them and not even thinking about it, thinking about the disease of addiction. They gave me that and my mom was the one who started peening for them. I tried for about a day to tell her I don't want to give them to you. Well, I ended up throwing them and told her, I said, hell, leave the money on my counter because we was selling them for like $2 a pill. And I said, if you want to take them, I didn't really want the money. I ended up selling my mom the pills that pretty much took her life at the time. You can only imagine what a 19-year-old kid would think about that with the disease of addiction. It was horrible. What had happened to her was she had taken the pills with the liquid and time-release methadone and it had stopped my mom's organs and she ended up having a brain aneurysm where the oxygen stopped going to her brain and she died in her sleep. She was perfect the day before and she was gone the next. So I went through that. She was my best friend my whole life. I went through that and afterwards I got really depressed. We had ended up coming into a lot more money from my mom's insurance. We came into, we probably had a couple hundred thousand dollars, me, my dad, and my sister. For the most part, I was a pretty good kid and you and me did everything my dad ever asked me but also got anything I ever wanted. When the money came and my mom was gone, I didn't know where to turn to. I just wanted to be numb. I started out with cocaine. I started out using cocaine and drinking heavy every day. That went on for a couple years. I remember after my mom had passed, the first time I wanted to get clean was after noticing what my dad had went through from losing his wife. I had went through hell seeing him like that and I went in there. I said, he said, why don't you go get some help? I told him. I said, what do you suggest? You know, what could I do? Those were my words with my mindset at the time. I said, what could I do? I could quit and just leave my whole life. This obsession that just doesn't stop. Never goes away. I remember fighting with him every day. Never once did I reach out to go to a power that's greater than myself, which I couldn't do anything without my higher power today. Realistically, I had to get sick and tired of being sick and tired. I had been introduced to, I had been pushed to strive for better and go to church. My family believes in that, going to pay your respects to that, believe it or not. We was in and out of church a lot growing up. How I came to that is my higher power is going to be in the worst places at the worst times, because there ain't nothing in this world that could save you from that. Because us addicts were completely powerless to the disease of addiction. If you break down the words in good guy that I met in the program, he broke it down to me. He said, you ever broke down the word disease? I said, no, he says dis-ease. If you break that down, that's what you get. That thing, the feeling that we get, it's unbearable. You might just have to figure out what powerlessness means and ask for help. I believe that every addict that I've ever met has got to a point where he or she has got there. The first thing they do is say, help me, because I'm helpless at the time. When I was at the bottom, I like to say, people say, you ever hit rock bottom? I say, I always tell them, man, my name is Larry. I'm power-glided on rock bottom. I liked where I was at. Several times, several times, I can't think of, I'd be lying if I said that this last time was only time, this last time that I went back out and then came back was the only time that God's ever saved me. God has been, my higher power has been saving me since I was 13 years old, since day one. He's been with me and I think I'm pretty blessed for that. Pretty blessed to have everything I have today. I'm lucky to be alive. I've had several overdoses. I've been in and out of prison, jail, poverty, homelessness, admissions, you name it, like programs from here to Timbuktu. I mean, Oxford House has definitely saved my life. I got into Oxford House about 13 months ago, but you got to be willing. It's a place of recovery and you got to be willing to put the step work in. You got to be willing to strive for your accountability. You got to be willing to strive to, you know, like, I mean, really what it showed me is kind of like in the basic text is my favorite story in there. It showed me what this meant and it says in there, there's a guy's story in the basic text that says, if you put one hand in the hand of an experienced member of Narcotics Anonymous and you put another hand in the hand of an inexperienced member, you can look down and you won't have any hand to pick up. And that's what this support has showed me. My support group is huge now throughout church services and recovery services. And I mean, you name it, I've been through it. But to get back where I was, the cocaine had taken me through obstacles with losing money. I ended up losing my grandfather's house. Me and my family did, you know, trying to get me clean. So I ended up losing everything. Was dwindling down on my money and my luck with the cocaine that ended up going to I can went to one of my buddies and I said, I said, man, what do I do? He said, and he's sitting there smoking meth, obviously going through it himself. And so he introduced me to meth. You know, it wasn't the first time that I did methamphetamine. The first time I did methamphetamine, I was in a 30 plus gang task force. It was a gang task force raid on a house that they were looking for a gang member my very first time using methamphetamine. And there's about 30 officers with ARs and you'd only, you know, you could only imagine how terrifying it was not knowing what was in the house. They actually pulled out all the drugs and left them there after they couldn't. We didn't have any information for them. They left everything there. Their job is there for gang task force. They're not there for drugs. They're not a narcotics division. So that was pretty wicked. That was my first time. But so after I got into the methamphetamine game, I remember the day I started using meth, not even knowing what was in the stuff. I didn't know how it was made. I didn't know what was in it. All I know is I like to get high and that was my next high. I ended up doing that, you know, ended up feeling really, you know, horrible. Really, I felt like I was in another world. You know, it took me took me to a different dimension is what I did. I did that and that's where it started. And nobody wanted to talk to me anymore. You know, I was becoming this person that was going to go through hell and high water. And I did. I methamphetamine took me to, I mean, took me to places that I mean prison. My first time I did my first prison bid, all the prisons were full and in California. So they let me sit in 23 one and in the hole. In little town, little town of Woodland, it was a county, county prison sentence. They could literally, they'd give you double days for, they'd give you two per one. And when I went in there the first time I got clean off of the meth, you know, I had lost everything. I was homeless, you know, you can only imagine the horrible things that, you know, that I had to see. This is just horrible. I ended up, I ended up going in there. I remember getting clean for my first time in, in county and after my bid was done, they, I was supposed to get out to go into a recovery home. There was like in San Francisco area, they were going to come pick me up, which they did. But right when I got to the front doors, I ended up, they asked me if I was on any medication. And I told them, I said, I'd done some sleeping pills in there, you know, just to sleep. And they said, well, we can't take you. And, you know, I, I, I wanted to turn around and go right back in there. I didn't want to go back to being homeless anymore. I didn't want to, I didn't want to do the drugs no more. And being homeless, that was only lifestyle that I was going to get. So around that went on for a while and ended up getting into a thing called Buddy's House out in UBIS City, California that I did. I was around a bunch of bikers and, and Christians and you name it, it was just super cool. It was like an Oxford house almost where men live with other men and pay their equal share, you know, it was super cool for the first time. And, and they had high hopes for me. Well, you know, all of us are the relapse King Joe, like that's what we do is go back out, you know, either stay in or either you're all in or you're all out, you know, and I decided that a good life wasn't good enough for me, you know. So that, that I did that for a little while and then then my drug addict family had a little intervention for me after I had went back out. They had an intervention for me. You can only imagine what it's like having, you know, Fyretin addict sitting around telling you, yeah, you're the worst one, you should move. I said, I said, you know, you give me a bus ticket, I'll get the out of here. So I ended up moving to Emporia, Kansas. I was there for about a week before I caught another charge and I, you know, I was, I got out, got into the mission afterwards, you know, did I did about two years on that one, got into the mission afterwards because there ain't really a whole lot of recovery. There's a lot of recovery in Emporia, but there's not a lot of recovery houses for men, you know, the felons and all that stuff out there. I ended up, I ended up going there and got out, got did good for a little while, got to work and, you know, that money, money does it every time for me. I mean, I get a big old stack of cash in my pocket and I'm back at it. I did that for a while, did good, you know, just wanted to stay out of jail for the most part, but something, something that happened to me where I wanted to get clean in that time, they ended up letting me move to Topeka, Kansas and I believe it was like 2019, so about five or six years ago, came out here, met some hardcore recovering addicts, you know, that was like not going to put up with my bullshit. I can tell you that much, they was not, they, but they, they didn't know what they was in for either, you know, I was all around good dude that could, that could, you know, break every bit of that down in 10 seconds, you know, I was really good at destruction, is just I never really showed it. They gave me the chance to either change or go back where I was going to be at, you know, first time it didn't work. I was like, I'm going to be in the either change or go back where I was going to be at, you know, first time it didn't work. I got kicked out, I got kicked out of Topeka and they sent me, they sent me right back to where, where I was going, you know, which was Emporia, I had to go back to Emporia and that was, that was, man, I was, felt like I was going right to jail, you know, I ended up going to prison, I cut off a GPS monitor system and hell was going crazy. I ended up cut it off, had to go do 18 months for drug court, plus another like year for, for cutting the monitor off, went to Hutch, got out, went back to Emporia and I was on a road of homelessness again, you know, I was like, hell, I'm better off in prison, you know, sit me in here, they said, my pro officer said, Larry, just you could do this, you know, I said, if y'all can't get me into something I ain't going to, and I felt like a piece of crap, I said, I said, y'all are throwing me to the, the wolves, she said, I said, for real, you know, I mean, there's a lot of circumstances on it, you know, I had like a $400 voucher from, I had $400 voucher from Salvation Army that was, that was going to help me, and I just needed to get the other, the other half of the rent, and I could have got me a place, but nobody could help me at the time, so I said, I said, help put me back in, put me back in prison, you know, I got a year of parole, and she said, I'm not going to do that. And I told her, I said, why the hell won't you, you know, like, what, I'm a bum, I said, I'm a felon, I'm out here, I'm, I ain't no good, I'm going to go back to using drugs, if you don't let me, let me, you know, don't, don't let me go back in, she said, she said, I got a place for you, and she's like, it's out in Topeka, I said, I said, oh yeah, you want to send me to Topeka? I said, I said, just, you know, just throw me to the bigger crowd of wolves, this is what I thought, but I came out here, I got into a, didn't get into Oxford right out the top, but I got into a thing called Work a Minute Christ, and that was pretty cool, I ain't gonna lie, Work a Minute Christ was amazing, I mean, it shows you how to, shows you a lot about, you know, structure, you know, building structure for your life, you know, got to do amazing things with that guy, and I finally wanted to be clean, the guy who runs it, I finally wanted to get clean, he, he started introducing me to all kinds of people, started allowing me to volunteer for all kinds of work, got to, I got to go with him to a guy named Spencer Lindsey, I got to go with him to NASCAR, and work at NASCAR out there at the Speedway, the actual NASCAR races, and I believe, believe it's Kansas City, or Wichita, one or the other, but I got to go with him two years in a row, and they loved me, and I came across, in prison, I came across this book that a buddy of mine out here, his name is Bill Corum, had, had wrote, I was, I was doing my first bid in Kansas, and I came across this book called The Ultimate Pardon, this guy had done so much crazy stuff, and I'd read this book, and I, and I didn't have anything where I was at, in, because I was in El Dorado when I found it, and I was in El Dorado prison, and when I found this, they had me in the restricted area, where I, I got out for, got out of that room for, what, like five minutes every, like, three days to go take a shower, and I had nobody in there, the TV was like 60 feet away from my cell, and there was no volume, it was on soccer, you can only imagine how horrible it was, but the, one of the guys that goes around giving out these books, you know, about recovery, and all this stuff, had handed me, I said, let me get that one, I read it, and it was my favorite book, it's about a guy who, who gives people like me a second chance, and this gentleman, it was so cool, I mean, this dude was, he was, he was the worst of the worst, and he, I read it, and I loved the book, well, when I came to work him in a Christ, and got with this team, I remember, I remember the guy's name, and across my buddy, my, what's that called, the person who teaches you how to do all this, I forgot what it's called, but Spencer Lindsey on his phone, it said, Bill Corum, when it, when it, when it, when it crossed, I could see it, when we were driving, he says, I said, Bill Corum, the author, and he said, he says, yeah, I said, I said, stop joking, and he says, it's my best friend, he, he ended up taking me, he said, he said, I'll call him right now, he said, you don't believe me, I said, I said, there's no way, dude, I said, that's the guy that I did, his book made me want to get clean, he, I said, you know, because somebody like that, they could go do all this horrible stuff, and go through all these things, you know, pretty much Bill and Condemned, if he could change, I could change, is what I said, well, hell, he, I got to talk to Bill Corum, you know, the guy who wrote the book, he's, he's, he's on there, he says, yeah, that's me, and I got to meet him, but my disease, my disease, it, it, you know, for the longest time, I didn't do the steps, you know, long as time, I didn't do them, I didn't, I didn't trust him in a sponsor, I didn't, I didn't trust anybody, you know, after I got out of that, I got into another discipleship home, where I got to help a guy here in the Tepica area, build, build a church and recovery house, got to be a part of that, big part of that, I was his first student, that's Pastor Hank Hilton, I got, I got to be his first student and be a part of that, it was amazing, did better than I ever did in my whole life. After all these years, after all these, these years of messing up and it took, I believe I left when I was 24, and when I got with Pastor Hank, I was probably about 30, probably about 31 or 32, when I started doing this discipleship program. He, I finally got my dad, my dad was in, in California, at the Walmart, and nobody would help him, no, he hadn't had, he had called me, I called him on my birthday actually, he didn't call me, I called him on my birthday, and he said, son, I don't have any food, no water, no gas, no smokes, nothing, and I said, I said, hell, I said, you know what today is, he says, nope, I says my birthday, man, I said, I said, I'll have somebody come by there, well, I had gotten, you know, pretty good at this job at Southwest Publishing and got pretty good, and they, they, the money was stacking up, and I got my dad to come out here, I said, I said, I'm at recovery, want to help you out, and he came out here, we got him, we got him a little spot, a little house, and, oh, he started, you know, my dad, my dad's still clean today, from that he's been clean for, oh, I think going on like three years, something like that, two or three years, after that, you know, I did good for a while, did good for a while, went, me and my dad was living there, my dad's now in a resting, or in a, um, old folks home, um, today, um, and he's, and he's sober, that's the, that's the amazing thing, you know, um, so then after that, after Hank's program, I got it, I got out there, I had me a house for a while, um, which is the reason why, why I decided to move into Oxford house in the first place, and out here in Topeka, I decided to do that, um, because I couldn't hold the house without, without using drugs, like, I, I, you know, me under those circumstances, I couldn't do it, I, I, I was losing my toodles, and, uh, uh, that may, I had kept the house for about a year or so, and then, uh, ended up a buddy of mine, from prison, offered me to live with him for a little while, when my dad got sick and went to the retirement home, he, uh, he offered me to stay there, and then I did good financially for a while, uh, and then I, I ended up meeting somebody that was in the Oxford program, and they asked me, they said, Larry, you know, you're all just staying clean here, a lot higher than, uh, anywhere else, you know, so I got into about 13 months ago, um, and I've been in, in and out, you know, I mean, I've been in and out, I've lived like two or three times, helped open an Oxford house out here with a buddy of mine, um, just been a support, really the best, best way to stay clean for me is to be a support to someone else, you know, you can't keep what you got unless you're giving it away, you know, uh, but so on my last time going out, uh, two days shy of six months ago, um, and I was going through it really bad, and, um, having, having hot flashes of using the needle, and, um, these just, these nightmare, night terrors wouldn't stop, and I ended up I ended up, you know, giving in to the temptation, you know, um, my, my drug addiction over the years has went from pills to cocaine to methamphetamine, um, to methamphetamine with fentanyl, pure fentanyl, uh, I mean, you name it, you know, all, all of the above, all these prescription pills while they're doing, you know, these hardcore drugs, you know, uh, it just progressively got worse, you know, heroin, heroin, I always said I'd never use heroin, well, when I was in a house, I had heroin addicts, I sure as hell used heroin, I ain't gonna lie, uh, not proud of it at all, you know, but, and, uh, so anyways, I got to, I got that far in that, in that world, you know, did a lot of really horrible things, um, you know, that I'm working on to, um, working to get, get off my chest and give away, and, you know, how I'm, I'm, today I asked my higher power to help me with all these things, and, um, I'm, I work on it with a sponsor, you know, I've had probably like six or seven sponsors since I really started working the steps, I made it to, um, right now I'm on my step 10, which is about inventory, so inventory is really big, you know, you, we only, us addicts, we live one day at a time, so, you know, I mean, I can't help what I did yesterday, you know, and I sure as hell don't want to think about it, but, um, like, today I can do the best I can, you know, one day at a time, and, um, you know, I, hell, after, uh, almost six months, I've, I've got, I've stayed in Oxford, I pay my bills, I hold the job, I, uh, I'm a good friend, you know, which is huge to me, I mean, I got to key to my own place, you know, I mean, I never had a key when I was doing drugs, I, I wouldn't trust it with anything like that, um, I'm, I, I've, I've done, helped people who needed help, you know, and when it didn't, wouldn't hurt me or another, you know, um, I live my life by the steps, the 12 steps and 12 traditions of narcotics anonymous, uh, go to meetings all the time, if I didn't have a meeting every day, I wouldn't, I wouldn't know what to do, um, but the best way to, to get a support group, I would say to anybody out there is to be a support group for somebody, you know, be a service to somebody, get out there, do service, uh, get, get into something and be a part of something and, you know, let, let your higher power, um, take it from there. I, I, one thing, one thing I noticed about a conversation in life is, you know, when, when I, you know, talk to somebody, I expect them to talk back to me, you know, and with my higher power, when I pray to him and he helps me, my, my higher power helps me, he wants me to keep that relationship going, you know, and, um, save us from the, the, you know, this enemy who's working overtime to get you where, where you, uh, where he had you, or even worse, you know, death, you know, jail's institutions are death. Um, so you're in a good spot now? Yeah, I'm in a great spot. Yeah, I'm in a great spot. Um, I got, I live with, uh, well, five senior members of my Oxford house or are my best friends and, uh, the percentages, they could go up, you know, that's, that's, that's what I can say because they say that, um, um, only 2% makes it out of, you know, your, your recovery group and rehab, you know, well, hell, we got 3% just in my house because we stick together and we, we hit meetings and we help others, you know, like whatever we, whatever we got, we've given it away. Those, those guys, they, they come and say, thank you. And I'm seeing today after, after doing that for six months and today, I get to see these other new recovering addicts, you know, after a month, their recovery, they're, they're starting to give theirs away and they, and we're getting to thank you back, you know, I mean, realistically, like that's all, that's all my power is everything we've done is, is my power of even being able to do what I'm doing right now, hopefully giving the message out to an addict who, you know, is still out there, you know, you know, like understand powerlessness is what I would say, you know, try to, try to ask for help and understand that you're powerless over your addiction, give yourself a break, you know, don't pick up. It's not worth it because, you know, it don't ever stop. It don't ever stop until you find some help and identify your problems, you know, identify that, that this thing inside of you is a disease, you know, and it's a progressive illness that if you feed it, it'll take everything. That's pretty much all I got right there. you",loaded_from_file,29573,Recovery-Larry's Story,2324.0,11,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00
_zw6oavsfUk,"Where does it begin? I mean, you could probably say, I mean, maybe in high school when I smoked weed for the first time, I don't know where it begins. But I never was affected negatively until senior in college during a specific event that happened. I smoked weed for maybe like 10 years before I had any negative effects or anything, maybe a little less. In high school, only socially, so not that often, kind of whenever it was happening. In college, maybe like weekly. So really not crazy. I mean, enough, but people around me were smoking every day all day. To me, it was kind of a weekly thing. I would smoke casually throughout college. And what happened was I got the flu or something like that. And so it kind of affected my throat, and so I didn't really want to smoke so much. But I really enjoyed weed. So I started taking a lot of edibles. That was my senior year of college. And then one day, one night, I was kind of coasting to taking a lot more than I was comfortable with. At that point in my life, I was kind of, I was not feeling good about myself. I was really, really stressed out about graduating college and just kind of feeling really down, probably depressed. But nothing dangerous. And then I did a very high dose of edibles for me, even though I was doing edibles consistently. That night, I took a higher dose, and I just totally lost it and became super suicidal that day as a result of the high, which I had never had a thought like that before in my life. I just took like three or four of them as opposed to what you'd normally do. One or two. So it wasn't not drastically crazy high, but just clearly enough to just set me over the edge. So it wasn't, it didn't seem like something crazy risky, something nothing, nothing crazy. Yeah, so that night, it was just different than how it had been the rest of the year. And I just spiraled into, I just, I don't know, under the high, I was like 100% convinced my life was over. And that was just really terrifying. And I never had that experience before. And I just, it just put my life in perspective and it distorted my vision of my life to make it seem like I was going to die soon. So I called my, like, went to my friend's room, like crying. I was, yeah, I didn't kind of freaked out. Yeah. And I don't think that would have happened if I was doing great in my life outside of that. I think the fact that I was not in the best place emotionally, I think then doing that just set it over the edge is what happened. It's kind of amped everything up. Yeah. Yeah. And it kind of, in like, with what happens with weed, it can kind of exaggerate things and distort things. So how I was feeling outside of it was kind of exaggerated and then distorted to an insane level. I was probably just too out of it and too high to remember, like, what exactly happened that night. But yeah, then the days and weeks after just was a continued spiral. It, like, totally just shifted my entire mentality. So even when I was sober, that feeling stayed. I just was not functioning at all. I was, I had, I think from all the fear and the anxiety that I was, like, dying, I just stopped eating. I had no appetite. Like, at a certain point, I couldn't even swallow, like, food. And so I was just that alone, combined with, like, where my, I was mentally, I just was not doing well. I remember just driving around like camp, college campus, like, not knowing what to do. Like, like, I don't know, I just had no food, no sleep. I wasn't sleeping at all. So I was just kind of wiling out of control. I just didn't know how to, what to do. I didn't know, I didn't, I don't know how to describe it. I just didn't know what to do. Like, I was just kind of wandering. Like, I don't know. I was like lunatic. And I was sober. And I was, yeah. Here's what happened. So I was just kind of wandering, not knowing what to do. Then at a certain point, I woke up one morning and I was doing that same routine, just kind of driving around, like, no position to be driving. And I just called the suicide hotline. And they, they just were zero help. They're just like, go drive to this far off area. I'm like, I'm not going to make it out there. And so I'm just kind of driving around campus, not know what to do. And eventually I just broke down and had to call my parents, which was like the last resort, like I did not want them involved. But yeah, I just kind of broke down the side of the road. And then I would call my parents and I literally couldn't even, I don't know, I guess I couldn't even like drive home. I don't know why. I don't know what was up, but I literally was like parked on the side of road, like couldn't do anything. I just sat at the side of the road, waited for my parents to drive all the way from Denver. So yeah, then they drove up. They realized, obviously the state I was in. And they took me, I was obviously taken to the, the school's mental health people. And they had me fill out a survey. Like what are you, what's going on? How are you feeling? And I just, I just answered, idiotically answer 10s, like throughout the whole thing. And I'm sitting with a psychologist or psychiatrist in the room. And all of a sudden, like two policemen break in and just cuff me and take me to the psych ward just that quickly against my will. And at that point, I'm like 100% sure my life is over. Yeah. It's a mystery to me. I mean, I'm just one second, I'm sitting in the psych ward talking to the, or not, not the psych ward. I'm sitting in the school's psychologist's office just talking to them. Next second, the police bust in. So what I believe is the case is that they were talking to me and they deemed that I was not okay since such a headspace to be in public. And so they just called the police and they took me along with my answers to the questions. I learned quickly that you can't trust that I wasn't able to trust, tell anyone the truth or tell anyone anything of authority. Ultimately, did that help you? It's a good question. The psych ward set me on a very bad path. So no. But at the same time, what would I have done otherwise? It's also another question. Yeah. Like, where would you? Yeah. I just think society doesn't have an answer to these things. My reality was totally distorted. I literally thought I was the most messed up person on earth. I just had no hope. And I just like presented like I was a normal person, but I really got to the psych ward and I saw everyone and Holly's create like, I don't want to call anyone crazy, but like, you know, a lot of people who are really struggling and I looked at them and I'm like, yeah, I'm way more messed up than them. I'm they, I just, people just don't know. I was totally distorted. Um, and so in that psych ward, it kind of like, yeah, I was able to like maybe connect with some people who I would never connect with. And that was maybe a little helpful, but like, um, yeah, no, it kind of sent me, it was bad also because I just, I just thought I was just totally screwed. Totally. It's over. Um, and then the site in the psych ward, they gave me, you know, they just pump you up on medications, just to sedate you. Um, and that in the moment, when I was really high on all their meds, I was, that was the only glimpses of like, maybe I'm a B R A. Um, but then the meds aware off and it'd be all over. And, uh, the meds that they got me on messed me up even more in the end. They gave me, they, you know, they put me up heavy on out of the out of them when I was in psych ward, which was what they do. Um, and it was the only thing that I was able to function on. Nothing else helped besides out of van, um, which is a, you know, the. Heavy benzodiazepine. Um, and so I kept, um, getting it from a psychologist from a psychiatrist after I got out of the psych ward, I kind of was able to almost fake. I was able to fake my way out of the psych ward by just acting like I was okay, even though it wasn't. Um, and then I just continued to get those medications, um, from a fair most psychologist, from a psychiatrist, um, not being informed of, of what they were or, or rather how. Yeah. Really understanding of the addictive nature of those. Um, and so I was taking them and, uh, I, um, at one point I just dropped off cold turkey from them. Um, and this was these, these medications, I think combined with whatever happened to me back in college. Um, those two things combined kind of really made me very suicidal. Um, those, those, those, uh, those medications I learned later also can cause that. Um, so yeah, I was just, I just dropped off from cold turkey. Um, sorry, this is kind of getting a long story. Um, but yeah, I, uh, I dropped off from cold turkey and I was driving around, um, driving over each because that was my only way to make money at the point at the time and, uh, I told him my car. Um, and at that point it was like a pretty low, low. Um, and I was just totally wiling out. Um, and then that's when I was kind of needed, clearly needed to go to rehab. Um, I didn't want to go. Um, I was kind of not forced into it. Um, I, like I played an act role of going, but I did not want to go. Um, but yeah, that, that rehab facility is kind of the thing that actually helped me get better. That's cool because we don't hear a lot of positive things about rehab facilities. It, there are stories that we do. Certainly they're terrible. Um, 99% of them are terrible. Um, what they do is they just load you up on drugs, um, just to sedate you as, right as you walk in the door. Um, and then their only goal is to just keep you under control and keep you sedated until they can get out. Until your insurance runs out. Until your insurance runs out. Um, this one particularly was a particularly, um, expensive one, a particularly open, different one. Um, they had a lot of, a lot of education there. It was like a, it was like a luxury rehab. It was a, it was a very luxury. Um, so it was very different than a lot of the other ones. I imagine that helps. Yeah. You know, just being out in nature, um, out in the desert was really helpful. Connecting with other people, going through it. There's another part of the story. Um, so yeah, I get, I get to rehab. I'm pretty much dragged there. Um, and so I, I did not have any idea that he could possibly help me whatsoever. And so I get to rehab. I'm not doing well. I didn't, I don't trust anybody there. Um, and I just run away from the rehab. Um, yeah, which you're not supposed to be able to do. Yeah. So, uh, they just took us out on a smoke break. Um, and, uh, when the guard wasn't looking, I just kind of booked it. Um, and yeah, so I'm just kind of running out into the desert. No one notices. And then I just sit down, kind of lost in the desert. Like, what do I do? And there was a search party that came and found me and that was dragged back. Um, and at that point I was like, all right, literally there's nothing else I can do here. I've already ran away. So I just have to lean into this. I was kind of dodging the system a little bit. You know, I wasn't, I think I was fake taking some of the meds that are trying to get me. Um, and really just the thing that helped me was I didn't feel like it was a rehab facility. I felt like I, I understood that what it was and what they were doing. Um, and it was really just the people in there that helped me the most. Um, they made me feel normal again. In terms of marijuana specifically, um, is something that can ruin your life. If you are not careful and that is not something that anyone's aware of until it happens to you. Um, I, if I, if my family didn't have a lot of money and I wasn't able to go to this crazy expensive rehab, uh, I would not be alive right now. Um, and so I think marijuana specifically is a, is a plant. It's a, uh, it's a spirit. It is something that has wisdom in it and it's not all bad. Um, but if you are not in a good mental space, it can ruin your life. And if you do it haphazardly, it'll ruin your life. And if you don't do it with intention, it can ruin your life. Um, it's not a good idea, especially if you're not a good mental place to just do it quote for fun. Um, do it with intention. Um, or don't do it.",loaded_from_file,12211,"CANNABIS INDUCED PSYCHOSIS - Seth Juris' Story, ep.8",956.0,52,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdCPA32W_p39Z8hi7xSIX3Fkqmhd7mRzj&si=1NuXOm3x_FauXwSH,2025-10-24T20:37:36.824506+00:00
